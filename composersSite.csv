Margins and Periferies | Call for new scores,12/03/2023 23:59,Online,"“Piazza del Mondo” is very excited to announce the Call of Scores “Margini e periferie / Margins and peripheries” focusing on key-themes and values such as:

margins - periphery - local - center - difference

The current attitude and way of life  that tends to depersonalize individuals leads to reconsider margins and peripheries: a local dimension that can testify the persistence of some propositive values today. 

How to recover these visions that address us from the margins, from a relative distance? How can they fertilize our present time? This is the point raised by our Call.

Our aim is to highlight individual needs and promote a polycentric  perspective that values different cultures that, through their polyphony, can enrich the community with their stories, viewpoints and sensibility.

Applicants may be of any nationality and age.




Applicants may submit only one work.




Submitted works must not exceed 15 minutes length.

McKnight Visiting Composer Residencies,14/03/2023 23:59,Online,"Program Description

    American Composers Forum will select two music creators for an artistic residency in Minnesota.




    Artists work with the ACF team to design and produce a residency that integrates with the Minnesota community in a unique way.




    Visiting composers spend approximately 30 days in Minnesota over an 18-month period, building relationships and working on projects.




    New work may be part of the residency, but the focus is on the exploration of an artist within a Minnesota community. ACF believes in the power of music creators to be storytellers, connectors, or catalysts through their art. This program invites artists to respond to or reflect on the unique qualities of people and communities in our home state.

Awards

    Up to two residencies of $10,000 will be awarded. All funds are distributed directly to the selected music creator across four installments. Awards are subject to state and federal income tax guidelines.

CALL FOR SCORES SPHERES OF A GENIUS 2023 – HONORING CARLA BLEY,20/02/2023 23:59,"Vienna, Austria","CALL FOR SCORES




SPHERES OF A GENIUS 2023 – HONORING CARLA BLEY




A jazz composition competition by JAM MUSIC LAB University (JMLU) in cooperation with the ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra (RSO). The prize-winning work will be premiered on October 4th 2023 in the Grand Hall of the Konzerthaus Vienna under the direction of Marin Alsop. The concert will be recorded by ORF and broadcasted on the Ö1 program.

RSO and JMLU are continuing their first collaboration from 2017/2018. The composition competition “Spheres of a Genius” was based on the 100th Birthday of the jazz composer and pianist Thelonious Monk. The subsequent competition paid homage to Leonard Bernstein.

This third “Spheres of a Genius” event pays tribute to Carla Bley.

IDEA AND OUTLINE OF THE COMPETITION




As a pianist, composer and arranger, Carla Bley first distinguished herself in the 1960’s. She entered the realm of modern creative music – then known as free jazz - producing numerous genre-bending works that stand as touchstones in the development of modern music. Her efforts forged new modes of expression that both reflected and expanded jazz’s conventions.

With the aid of illustrious collaborators – which included Pharoah Sanders, Steve Lacy, George Russell, Steve Swallow, Gary Burton and Charlie Haden - in groups large and small - Bley created a singular voice that continues to inspire forward-thinking artists.

She has shaped generations of music-makers, and her work serves as a model for utilizing jazz’s important innovations in the context of contemporary music. Bley's work continues to inspire women in jazz to arrange and compose, and to help nurture the expansion of groundbreaking ideas.

THE AIM OF THE CONTEST




The task of the composition competition relates to the role of Carla Bley as a composer. The winning piece shall succeed in transferring the impulses shaped by her into a demanding musical language of the 21st century.




The special challenge of placing the idioms of jazz in the context of a symphony orchestra should be taken into account.

The submitted composition should embrace her adventurous spirit, utilizing and developing stylistic elements that demonstrate a thorough deliberation of her recorded works. The composer’s aim is to create music showing evidence of inspiration. Innovation and originality will be rewarded.

For much of its development, jazz was a male-dominated genre. Carla Bley made significant contributions leading the way among arrangers, composers and band leaders. Because of her, woman now forge creative opportinites and advancements that push the music forward. She is a central figure and an important role model for the growing group of female composers in jazz. (Marcus Ratka)

Emerging Black Composers Project,01/02/2023 23:59,"San Francisco, United States","THE SAN FRANCISCO CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC AND SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ANNOUNCE CALL FOR APPLICATIONS FOR THIRD ANNUAL EMERGING BLACK COMPOSERS PROJECT

This year’s competition looks to further identify and promote inventive Black musicians, of any music genre, under age 35; applications are due by February 1, 2023




SAN FRANCISCO, CA—The San Francisco Symphony, in partnership with the San Francisco Conservatory of Music (SFCM), announced today that applications are now open for the third annual Emerging Black Composers Project (EBCP).

The San Francisco Symphony, led by Music Director Esa-Pekka Salonen, will give the world premiere of a new work commissioned from the Emerging Black Composers Project prize winner. They will also receive a $15,000 award and mentorship from Salonen, SFCM Music Director Edwin Outwater and Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser, resident conductor of engagement and education at the San Francisco Symphony and chair of the EBCP selection committee. The winner will also receive career support and investment from SFCM faculty and musicians.

“It’s a real honor to participate in this ongoing project, which is needed and appropriate at this time in history,” said Bartholomew-Poyser. “We welcome a wide array of emerging voices, techniques, and aesthetics and encourage all music innovators to apply.”

“As we enter our third year, it is extremely inspiring to feel the community around this project grow,” said Outwater. “Hearing the premieres and seeing the effect this project has on our composers and our musical world is nothing short of thrilling.”

The Emerging Black Composers Project is a ten-year commitment to spotlight early-career Black American composers and their music. It was launched in 2020 with the first-place commission given in June of 2021 to Trevor Weston with additional prizes awarded to Sumi Tonooka, Shawn Okpebholo, and Jonathan Bingham. The 2022 Emerging Black Composers Project prize winner, Jens Ibsen, will have his work premiere with the San Francisco Symphony during the 2023–24 season.

The Emerging Black Composers Project set out to commission ten works in ten years, a goal that will likely be surpassed in that timeframe. To identify and highlight young artists and support their careers, the competition invites applications from composers 35 years of age and under.

“I want to say how incredibly amazing this program is because it’s a 10-year investment, and change takes time,” said inaugural winner Trevor Weston, who joins the Emerging Black Composers Project selection committee this year. “I have no idea where we will be in a decade, and how many more people will be affected.” 

All applications are judged through an anonymous process by a committee of leaders in the field that includes Carmen Bradford, Daphne Burt, Victor Goines, Blake-Anthony Johnson, San Francisco Symphony Collaborative Partner Nico Muhly, Valérie Sainte-Agathe, Jeff Zeigler, along with Bartholomew-Poyser, Outwater, Salonen, and Weston. 

Applicants are encouraged to apply today. This year’s Emerging Black Composers Project submission deadline is February 1, 2023; winners will be announced in spring 2023.

How to apply




Black American composers (U.S. citizens or permanent residents) aged 35 or under during 2023 who have completed a degree program in composition or music performance, or have equivalent experience, are encouraged to apply. 

Applicants must submit a resume along with three scores and recordings of past or current compositions reflective of their work by 11:59pm PT on February 1, 2023.

The Dale Warland Singers Commission Award is presented by Chorus America in partnership with the American Composers Forum. It recognizes a chorus entering into an artistically meaningful and mutually beneficial partnership with a composer of their choice to contribute a new work to the choral repertoire.

DESCRIPTION




Choruses will apply for the award in partnership with a composer of their choice for a specified commission project.

The review panel will consider artistic quality, inclusion of diverse perspectives, investment in partnership with the composer, the impact of this funding to leverage the project, and the ability of the organization to fulfill the project. The panel will give a higher priority to commissions in earlier stages of development.

The award is made possible by the Dale Warland Singers Fund for New Choral Music, a permanently restricted endowment fund established in 2004 to honor Dale and the Singers. The Dale Warland Singers Commission Award was created in 2008.

This award reflects Chorus America’s and the American Composers Forum’s commitment to modeling equitable compensation practices for the field. The winning chorus will receive a cash award of $10,000. $7,500 of the award is designated towards the commissioning fee (paid to the composer) and $2,500 is designated towards travel to support in-person engagement with the project composer, production costs to present the project, and promotion costs for the concert and work. It is the responsibility of the chorus to reimburse the composer within ten days of receiving the award. The new work must be premiered by the chorus within two years after receiving the award.

ELIGIBILITY

Our Open Call for artists is now open and be accessed at: 

www.flyingcarpetfestival.org/apply

Flying Carpet Festival is the first mobile multi-disciplinary arts festival for vulnerable and refugee children living in difficult places worldwide. The Flying Carpet Festival was initiated in 2018 by Sahba Aminikia, a San Francisco-based Iranian American music composer, in collaboration with Her Yerde Sanat Dernegi (Art Anywhere Association), originally a social circus school and a cultural organization based in Mardin, Türkiye, near the Turkish Syrian border where 3.6 million refugees, half of whom are children are resettled. Other programs held by Her Yerde Sanat Dernegi include; Sirkhane (circus and acrobatic workshops), Sirkhane Darkroom (analog photography workshops), and Müzikhane (music workshops).

The festival annually brings 20-40 artists, musicians, dancers, acrobats, and storytellers to the Turkish Syrian border as part of an artist residency. It engages them in creating a cohesive artistic story-telling experience decorated with music, dance, circus arts, and visual projection for children of Syrian, Turkish, and Kurdish origin. The festival forms collaborations between artists-in-residence, local artists, and children artists.

Since its conception, The Flying Carpet Festival has reached out to 18,000 children through 46 live performances and 260 workshops and has hosted 95 artists. It also has been mentioned in San Francisco Chronicle, NPR, Associated Press, KALW, Medium, and I Care if You Listen.

  We are trying to create the codes of a new aesthetic style and manifestation and we call it ""New Authentism"". And we ask composers to write their works with these aesthetic codes. These codes and rules are;

Authentism but not ""tradition""; By that means we are trying to understand the original idea behind of the aesthetical world of mentioned civilisation, not to imitate the traditional phenomenon.

1)Authentism but not ""tradition""; By that means we are trying to understand the original idea behind of the aesthetical world of mentioned civilisation, not to imitate the traditional phenomenons.




2)Expression but not ""technos""; By that means we are searching for the embodiment of the musical ideas and the idea of ""music"" of an Authentical mindset, to search the shadow of this mindset instead of ""copy"" that.




3)Composer instead of musicolog; By that means, the origin-oriented creative mind of the composer, instead of the heavy, sonorous field of knowledge and restraint, covered with musicological burdens.

The rules;

1)Of course, no age limit.




2)No notation limit, you can use all the types.




3)No style limit; You can write as an Spectralist, New complexity follower or another. Just don't forget that we are searching for the ""authentic"" and the codes written above.




4)The name of the albüm is ""Haiku""; Use Japanese haiku poems, Japanese mindset and ""Authentics"".




5)You can use phoneme as well, this means as you composing you can use algoritms which generate ""Japanic"" words instead of ""Japanese"",as we call it ""Artificial Language Word and Name Generator"".

We want to release a digital album until June 2023. 3 pieces of the works that you will send will be published in this album, as well as they will be used in the concert repertoires of the ensemble.

Come As You Are: Vulnerability in the Concert Space,01/02/2023 23:59,"Kansas City, Kansas, United States","Objective:

The purpose of Come As You Are is to break down barriers of access in the concert space. Concert music has contributed greatly to performing arts though it has also, at times, stifled vulnerability, maintained privilege and created exclusive expectations of formality. Such steep barriers create separation between creators, performers and audiences. This can lead to the music and its spaces feeling inaccessible to those who may feel they lack the privilege, training and/or formality to be welcomed into an experience. Come As You Are aims to open up these barriers through reimagined musical experiences and storytelling in the concert space.

This year, Come As You Are has partnered with The Whole Person in order to more effectively create a concert experience that is accessible to people with physical, hearing, vision, cognitive and psychological disabilities.

Style Guide




Oboe Model: Loree Royal




Range: Bb3 - C7




-	Bb3 - Eb4, preferred dynamics are from mp - f. The natural tendencies of the notes may make it not sound as soft or as loud as notated.




-	E4 - to G6, comfortable in all dynamic ranges. Alternate fingerings can be used to make some notes softer or louder than original fingering allows.




-	G#6 - A6, preferred dynamics are mf - f. The natural tendencies of the notes may make it not sound as soft or loud as notated.




-	A#6 - C7 , pp - p. If writing these notes, please leave time for embouchure and fingering preparation.

General:




-	Fast technical passages are enjoyed. For reference, the fingerings associated with G major and D major are the easiest to play fast.




-	Upward intervals are easier than downward intervals. Intervals in either direction can be articulated or slurred, easiest when articulated.




-	Vibrato will be used unless indicated otherwise.

Extended techniques:




-	Circular breathing - can be done for long periods of time. Easiest on moving notes, but can be done on held notes. Easiest to use in mid- register, but can be done in all but the highest register (G6 - C7).




-	Flutter tongue - achieved by rolling ‘R’s’. Cannot be done for extended periods of time - more air leaves the embouchure during this. Easiest in mid-register, but can be done up to G6.




-	Multiphonics - refer to the books on contemporary oboe. Not all of the multiphonics will work the same on my Loree Royal as they do on the other oboe models used for the books. Please indicate fingering.




-	Harmonics - refer to books on contemporary oboe.




-	Pitch bends - can be done with embouchure and/or keys. Refer to books on contemporary oboe.




-	Double tonguing - can be done, easiest in mid register. I do not prefer periods of extended fast articulations, single or double tongue.




-	Alternate fingerings - the less fingers used in the original fingering, the more opportunities for alternate fingerings. These can be used for dynamics, tonal changes, or microtonal tuning.




-	Microtones - refer to books on contemporary oboe. Please indicate fingering, some can be done with embouchure.

Call for Scores for the North American Hammered Dulcimer,01/02/2023 23:59,"San Diego, United States","Dear fellow composers,

I am a serious composer, percussionist and hammered dulcimerist searching for new music featuring the use of the hammered dulcimer to perform and record in concert on June 14, 2023 (tentative) at the Conrad Prebys Music Center recital hall of UC San Diego.

Having been a concert percussionist since my youth, as well as a contemporary composer in my academic years, my discovery of the hammered dulcimer in a shop in Asheville, NC resulted in an infectious engagement. It is now my goal to advocate for the generation of new works for this historically underrepresented instrument in concert music. A precedent of new works for underrepresented instruments can be found in the recent repertoire boom for the accordion, for example. A precedent of hammered dulcimer concert music literature is shown through a series of beautiful works for the hammered dulcimer written by some notable composers (some noted in my document shared below), not to mention the various works for the many cousins of the North American version of the instrument (e.g., the santur, yangqin and cimbalom). It is ultimately my goal to present new works for the instrument to music festivals based in percussion and/or composition practices.

***Works which in some way engage with the contemporary classical music idiom are preferred for this call, but all original works will be considered. The instrumentation for this call is either for solo hammered dulcimer (North American version, size 20-19), or for solo percussion with hammered dulcimer incorporated into the set-up (if considering extra large mallet percussion, please limit to one item, and reach out to assess feasibility). Any percussion instruments will need to be borrowed from the school and there is no guarantee of availability for the performance date until requested. Works for hammered dulcimer and another one or two solo instrumentalists may be possible, but again, feel free to contact me first to assess potentiality of performance, as it depends on who is available at UCSD. Electronics are possible, but try to be fairly reserved in tech demands. A single USB midi foot-switch controller pedal is available. Please consider limiting electronics to stereo or reach out to assess feasibility of further channels if essential to your vision. Both standard and graphic notations are welcome.

There are no restrictions on who can submit works or the number of works submitted. You, as the composer maintain the rights to your work. By submitting your work, you are giving me permission to perform and record the work in (non-profited) concert(s). I unfortunately cannot offer a commissioning fee for this project. Only a select number of works will be chosen as can be prepared and fit into the concert. However, further works might be considered for future performances. Ideally, works will be under approximately 13 minutes long, but both longer and shorter works will be considered. You are more than welcome to be present for the performance, but travel costs or lodging cannot be accommodated.

The following link contains a document which outlines some information about the instrument and select compositions already in existence for the instrument, as well as a selection of possible extended techniques in its performance practice (not exhaustive!). There is also an image of my instrument and a selection of mallets I currently have available. I may add to or edit this folder with further helpful materials as I see fit or as requests come in.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1poJwHoRZUpxbC6kmAJ6sJA2gMM-pXP7R...

Please submit your work to the Google form, linked below this message. There is no fee for submission. Submissions are not anonymous. The work can have been performed before, but please indicate if this is so and where it was performed. Please include a short bio of yourself in your submission. Recordings of performance or midi is ideal, but not required. I look forward to seeing and hearing your work! Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions about the instrument or the call. I would love to hear from you.

STEVEN GERBER PROJECT CALL FOR SCORES 2022-2023,31/01/2023 23:59,"New York City, New York, United States","STEVEN GERBER PROJECT CALL FOR SCORES 2022-2023




C4: The Choral Composer/Conductor Collective, a New York City-based new music chorus, invites composers, especially BIPoC composers, to submit unperformed choral works with a conceptual connection to William Shakespeare, to be performed on C4’s spring 2023 concert in New York City.




​




As part of an ongoing collaboration with the Steven R. Gerber Trust, C4 will be performing Steven Gerber’s Sessions of Sweet Silent Thought, a setting of five Shakespearean sonnets (9, 30, 71, 129 and 130). To foster new music, the Gerber Trust is providing support for one or two new pieces to be performed as part of the same concert. Additionally, there will be a dedicated recording session leading to high-quality recordings of both Sessions of Sweet Silent Thought and the accompanying piece or pieces.




A $1,500 prize will be awarded for each selected piece. Additionally, a travel stipend of up to $500 is available for out-of-town composers who wish to attend the premiere.

Pieces to be considered should be about 4 to 10 minutes in length (these are not hard limits), and should not have been performed previously in public. They should tie into the theme of Shakespeare and his sonnets, but composers are free to experiment with the exact connection, anything from setting another (or even the same) sonnet, to examining what Shakespeare does and does not signify to the modern observer, and beyond. The composer must be able to show that they have rights to the text, if any.

All are welcome to apply (except composers who have performed with C4 within the last five years). We are particularly interested in supporting BiPOC composers. There is no application fee, but composers should submit only one work.  The deadline for submission is January 31, 2023. The winners will be announced by March 31, 2023. The concert will take place in May or June, 2023.

C4 is a 20- to 25-voice mixed chorus. We welcome adventurous vocal writing, but due to the unpredictability of COVID, we prefer pieces with no more than 6-part divisi. We prefer a cappella works.

We expect to select one or two pieces. C4 reserves the right not to select a piece, but hopefully that will not happen.

You may submit online by filling out our online submission form, or by emailing 

gerber-competition@c4ensemble.org

. Please submit a PDF of the score, and confirmation of your rights to the text, if any. An audio file is encouraged; it can be a computer rendition of the piece. We also strongly encourage a biography of up to 350 words. Judging will not be anonymous. If anonymity is important, we encourage you to apply to one of our regular commissioning competitions.

Feel free to contact us at 

gerber-competition@c4ensemble.org

 with any questions. Thanks; we look forward to seeing your work!

We don’t want our performance of your work to be a barrier to the future of the piece, and we also want to avoid any misunderstandings. The following applies to works selected by the group: C4 reserves the exclusive right to first performance through June 2024, and the exclusive right to first commercial recording for one year past the first performance. C4 reserves the right to record performances of the Work, in both audio and video formats. C4 reserves the right to future performances of the Work without further direct payment to the Composer. The Composer will own the copyright to the Work. The Composer retains the right to publish the Work, or to seek publication by a third party. The Composer retains the right to collect royalties for the Work. The Composer is not an employee of the C4, and the Work is not a “work for hire” as defined under current copyright law. All rights to the Work not specified above are granted to the Composer.




ABOUT THE ENSEMBLE

C4 exists to enrich artists and audiences alike, through passionate advocacy of new choral works, performing pieces written within the last 25 years, premiering and commissioning new choral works, and mentoring emerging singers, composers, and conductors of today’s choral music. C4 is a 24-voice ensemble collectively run by its members, and is one of the few choruses in America dedicated exclusively to performing contemporary music. C4 performs adventurous contemporary programming at a professional level, with stipends to its members making it a semi-professional ensemble. In addition to presenting the music of its own composer members, C4 programs the music of other emerging composers along with that of more established composers, filling an important niche in the cultural life of New York City.

The Leczky brothers of the Kodály String Duo are calling for new compositions to expand the string duo repertoire,None,"Vienna, Austria","The Leczky brothers of the Kodály String Duo are calling for new compositions to expand the string duo repertoire

KSDV-portrait

Sebastian and Marcel Leczky of the Kodály String Duo

With an aim to generate more repertoire for string duo, violinist Sebastian Leczky and cellist Marcel Leczky have formed the Kodály String Duo Vienna Contemporary programme, calling on composers to send scores for the instrumentation.

The brothers, who were born in Vienna and are of Hungarian descent, have taken their ensemble name from composer Zoltán Kodály, whom they state to be their inspiration due to his support for young musicians, as well as the monumental Duo op.7 for the string duo instrumentation.

Acknowledging the dearth of repertoire for string duo, Sebastian tells The Strad ’We know that the string duo genre was not as popular as the string quartet, but we would like to change that.

’Our main goal is to increase the repertoire to the level of other popular chamber music formations. Hopefully many more string duos will be established. The possibilities of a violin and cello together is huge, as composers of the past, like Kodály, Ravel and Glière have written for this formation.’

Composers interested in submitting scores for the Kodály String Duo’s consideration can do so via this Google form: 

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpNRV8rX2C4lcdfz6TT7DmnFd59exm...

or email 

kodalystringduo@gmail.com

Born in 2001, Sebastian is currently studying with violinist Ida Bieler at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, where he also attended the Pre-College department under Wladislaw Winokurow. He has also enjoyed musical input from Arkadij Winokurow and Boris Kuschnir. He is winner of the International Vasa Prihoda Competition and since 2019 is supported by the Vienna Philharmonic and Prima la Musica Wien’s young artist talent programme.

Marcel was born in 1999 and is currently studying with Kerstin Feltz at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. He has participated in masterclasses with several prominent cellists, including Wolfgang Emanuel Schmidt, Jens Peter Maintz, Johannes Moser, Miklós Perényi, István Várdai, Reinhard Latzko, Julian Steckel, Emilio Colon and Zlatomir Fung with a special invitation at the Kronberg Academy. He plays on a 1750 Testore cello.",https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpNRV8rX2C4lcdfz6TT7DmnFd59exm6p-I8H5M...,"[""Other""]",FALSE,"[""violin"",""music"",""string quartet"",""composition"",""string"",""arts"",""composer"",""cello"",""competition"",""duo"",""musician"",""compose""]"
Call for Arrangement Proposals — flourish! new music ensemble,None,"Tucson, Arizona, United States","We are flourish! new music ensemble and we based in Tucson, Arizona. We're five friends who eat, drink, laugh, and play together, and we're working on sparking joy in new music. We are putting out a call for arrangement proposals for ensemble comprising oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon and harp.

As an ensemble, we believe in equitable treatment of composers and other music creators. This is NOT a call for scores, and we ask that you do not write a new piece of music for us for free. We understand that composition is work, and we believe that composers and other music makes should be compensated for their work. 

We also understand is that part of being a person who writes music is having projects that don't go anywhere. Sometimes a piece falls through, or you wrote something for a contest and it didn't win, or you wrote something for a degree and it only got one performance and the recording sucks. We see an opportunity here to give these kinds of works new life and to provide composers and other music creators with useful, high quality documentation of their work. We can't afford to pay you to create new work (and we strongly encourage you not to write new works for free), but we can provide you with professional audio and video recordings of your work in exchange for the work of arranging for our instrumentation. 

flourish! is looking for works that inspire, include, or embody joy. We do not play traumatic music, and our audiences do not come to flourish! performances expecting to have to deal with tragedy and pain. We are only interested in music that is fun, beautiful, honest, passionate, authentic, and playful. We typically like everyone in the ensemble to perform every piece and are not looking for music that utilizes subsets of our instrumentation. We value inclusivity, visibility, and accessibility in our programming and will prioritize working with composers who have something unheard to say. 

There is no fee for entering this call for arrangement proposals and you may submit any number of works. We typically prioritize composers and other music makers born after 1980, but we are open to music of any style by anyone. This call for arrangement proposals will remain open indefinitely. 

Here's how this works:

You (the person who writes music) will fill out this form, and flourish! will review your submission. If we say yes, we will ask you to create an arrangement of the submitted work and we will create documentation of your work at our next available opportunity. We may ask for revisions or modifications based on the results of our rehearsals. If we say no, we will provide you specific feedback as to why we believe your work is not a good fit for us and encourage you to apply again with another work. 

Please DO NOT arrange your work unless we decide that we want each work you submit to be part of our repertoire. The last thing we want you to do is preemptively do work you should be compensated for without the guarantee of being it being performed and documented. 

flourish! new music ensemble has access to the following instruments:




Oboe, Oboe d'Amore, and/or English Horn




Clarinet in Bb, Clarinet in A, and/or Bass Clarinet




Alto and/or Tenor Saxophone




Bassoon




Harp (pedal)

Other instruments (soprano saxophone, baritone saxophone, lever harp, etc.) are not available.
