VOCES8 Composition Competition 2023,12/05/2023 23:59,Online,"VOCES8 Composition Competition 2023




Important information and how to enter




Competition Rules




- Only one work may be submitted per composer.




- Entries must be the composer’s original work - arrangements are not allowed.




- Pieces must be able to be performed live by the eight singers of VOCES8, without any additional




instruments or technology.




- Entries must not have received any sort of prior public performance or recording, and must be




unpublished.




- Pieces should take no longer than 4 minutes to perform, based on a metronome mark at the head of the




score. Substantial speed changes should be given a new metronome mark.




- The text set must be in English and must be in the public domain.




- Entries must be submitted anonymously (see detailed instructions below).




- The decision of the judging panel is final and no correspondence will be entered into regarding the




outcome of the competition.




- By entering the competition you agree, if chosen as the winner, to take part in post-competition publicity




and to your name being publicly known.




- By entering you agree to abide by these rules. Entries which do not comply will not be considered.




Tips on writing for VOCES8




The group consists of 8 voices in the arrangement SSACtTTBarB. Individual ranges are as follows:




- Andrea (Soprano 1) - C4 to D6




- Molly (Soprano 2) - A3 to C6




- Katie (Alto) - G3 to F5




- Barney (Countertenor) - G3 to E5 (Additional Bass-baritone range for harmonic filler E2 to G3)




- Blake (Tenor 1) - Eflat3 to Bflat4




- Euan (Tenor 2) - C3 to A4




- Chris (Baritone) - E2 to Fsharp4




- Dominic (Bass) - Eflat2 to D4




This represents the extremities of our ranges and might be better thought of as a guideline, rather than a




challenge!




We encourage composers to explore the possibilities of different textures that this arrangement of voices




allows. For example, VOCES8 often sings music in a double choir format, with two quartets of SATB. We




pay a lot of attention as a group to the “fundamentals” of a cappella singing such as the balance, tuning




and voicing of chords, and creating a blended group sound while also finding moments to bring out our




individual vocal colour. Furthermore as singers, we are lucky to work with text. We enjoy singing music that




expresses texts in innovative and nuanced ways while retaining a clarity of overall message.




How To Enter - please read carefully




Please email a full score as a pdf file to composers@voces8.foundation. This can be computer-typeset or




handwritten, but must clearly contain all instructions necessary to perform the piece, without additional




typesetting. Sending an mp3/midi mock-up with your score is strongly encouraged but not essential.




So that all entries can be judged anonymously you must submit your work under a pseudonym, which




should appear both at the top of the score and in the file name. Take care to ensure your real name does




not appear anywhere on the score or in the file name. In the body of the email, please state the following




information: your real name, age, and the country you live in. Your email address and personal information




will only be seen by an administrator outside the judging panel, in order to preserve anonymity in the




judging process. We will contact the winner via the email address used to enter, so please use an account




you check regularly.




The deadline for entries is Friday 12th May, 23:59 BST. You will be notified if your piece has been




selected for consideration by the judging panel by Monday 22nd May and the winner will be contacted by




Friday 2nd June.",https://voces8.com/composer-competition,"[""Other""]",FALSE,"[""bass"",""compose"",""harp"",""music"",""singer"",""composition"",""performance"",""competition"",""vocal"",""composer""]"

The competition will culminate in finals concerts at which the results will be announced and the prizes awarded. These concerts will be held in the autumn 2024 season in Kouvola and Kotka, two towns in the Kymenlaakso region of Southeast Finland where Uuno Klami was born, and the results will be announced and the prizes awarded after the finals concert in Kotka. The orchestra at these concerts will be the Kymi Sinfonietta.

The orchestra may be smaller than that specified above on condition that it comprises at least 20 players and does not exceed the maximum stated for each instrumental section. Works that do not comply with these specifications will be disqualified.

c) Works entered for the competition must not have been previously published or performed. Only one entry is permitted per composer. Composers awarded a prize in a previous International Uuno Klami Composition Competition may not enter for the competition again, but the parti-

Teaching Composition: A Symposium on Music Composition Pedagogy,01/06/2023 23:59,"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States","Teaching Composition: A Symposium on Music Composition Pedagogy

We are pleased to announce the second meeting of Teaching Composition: A Symposium on Music Composition Pedagogy, which will be held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT on Thursday, Sept. 28 through Saturday, Sept. 30, 2023. This conference fills an important gap in music scholarship. In other areas of music academia—for example, performance or theory—there are pedagogy journals, conferences, courses, and degree programs. In contrast, there are almost no such resources or programs relating to the teaching of music composition at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Similarly, the National Standards for Music, which outline topics and skills for K-12 music education, emphasize composing and improvising—yet music education students are rarely trained to teach those areas and may have limited experience in them as musicians. The Teaching Composition conference was created to address this gap in resources, discussion, and training. 

The program committee welcomes proposals for research presentations, posters, panels, and workshops/demonstrations that relate to any aspect of music composition pedagogy. 

Proposals may be submitted by college and graduate level instructors as well as those who teach pre-college and amateur adult composers. Students are eligible to apply. Presenters’ primary area may be composition or any other area of music (performance, theory, etc.). Proposals from individuals of historically excluded identities are highly encouraged.

Interested individuals or teams may submit proposals for in-person or online sessions in any format:

NYWC Seed Money Grant 2023 I,26/05/2023 23:59,Online,"Seed Money Grants




The New York Women Composers’ annual Seed Money Grant Program awards grants of $1,000 each for concert projects that include a substantial commitment to the performance of music by NYWC members. (Note: This is not a commissioning grant.) Application details will be circulated in mid-April of each year.

Applicants may be solo performers, ensembles or presenting organizations. Applicants do not need to be members of New York Women Composers, and the concerts are not required to take place in New York State.

Concerts for the grant period must take place from September of the application year to December of the following year.

General Guidelines




For concert grant applications, we offer two possible formats:

Focused Concert: Presentation of a concert featuring the works of three or more composer-members of New York Women Composers for at least half of the project’s time-length. At least one of the NYWC composers chosen must be new to the performers.




Disseminated performances: Performers or ensembles may instead choose to perform works by a minimum of five different NYWC members during their performance season, on two or more concerts. At least two of the NYWC composers must be new to the performers.




Call For Scores




The music to be presented will be chosen from a call for scores circulated on behalf of the grant recipients by NYWC. Although many composers do list works in the members’ online catalog on NYWC website, please be aware that this list is not complete, so a general score/recording call is preferred (either physical scores or PDFs) over catalog-only selection. The concert organizers choose the music they wish to play according to their tastes.

We ask that composers receive notification of rehearsal schedules with the option to attend at least one rehearsal; that printed programs be provided with information on the composers and the pieces, and if vocal music, song texts; and that performers vet the venue prior to booking to make sure it is suitable and that the acoustics and piano (if applicable) are suitable for the performance.

Finances and Project Completion




Seed Money Grant awards are $1,000. Any financial proceeds from the concert go directly to the organizers, not to the New York Women Composers organization. The selected composers do not have to pay any money to the organizers for the performance of their works. New York Women Composers is not responsible for any additional monies needed to complete the projects. A program should be provided to NYWC after the performance takes place; sound or video files are also appreciated, but not required.

Application Procedures




The applicant should submit a brief outline of the proposed project, along with professional biographical and promotional materials, and a sample sound recording. Applications will be judged by the following criteria:

1)  Project visibility

2)  Financial need

3)  Instrumentation

4)  Performing Rights Organizations licensing coverage for paid-admission concerts*

5)  Concert length

6)  New applicants will receive preference over those who have previously received New York Women Composers funding

To apply: 

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNTgy_nhne8E2eStc7Mehu1ZNcuUV6...

*Preference for grant selection will be made for concerts that are covered by performance licenses from ASCAP and BMI, so that composers may be remunerated. Some concert halls carry blanket licenses, but other venues do not. NYWC will be happy to provide information on how to secure single-performance licenses for your concert if your concert is not free admission.

60x60 Call for One-Minute Electronic Works,30/06/2023 23:59,"London, United Kingdom","The project is back! 60x60 is calling for works!

Vox Novus is inviting composers/sound artists to submit recorded works 60 seconds or less in length to be included in this special edition of the 60x60 project. 60 compositions will be selected to be played continuously in a one-hour concert. After a long hiatus, founder and creator Robert Voisey was inspired by the continuous dedication of Slippery Rock University to 60x60 Dance. This call for works is dedicated and created specifically for a new 60x60 mix for a multimedia dance performance at Slippery Rock University.

60x60 is a one-hour-long show made by sequencing 60 pre-recorded pieces by 60 different composers, each piece a minute in length or shorter. Highlighting the work of a great many composers, 60x60 testifies to the vibrancy of contemporary composition by present a diverse array of styles, aesthetics, and techniques being used today.

60x60 mixes have received more than 350 performances in more than 30 countries including venues such as the Winter Garden Atrium at Brookfield Place, NYC; Stratford Circus London for Opening Day Festival for the 2012 London Olympics, and Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 60x60 collaborates with multimedia including dance, video, photography, fine art, and theatre arts.

60x60 Dance was described by the New York Times as ""...60 new pieces of music, each lasting no more than 60 seconds - is quite mad. But it's this kind of madness that makes the cultural world go round...""

During the performance each of the 60 pieces selected will begin precisely at the beginning of the minute, this will mark the end of one piece and the beginning of another. There will be no pause between the pieces. Works may be less than 60 seconds in length, but may not exceed 60 seconds. Works selected that are less than 60 seconds long will be ""padded"" with silence either before, after, or surrounding the composition. Please note that the total duration of the work including silence may NOT exceed sixty seconds.

The 60x60 project's definition of a record work is as follows: any work created as a musical composition which is captured on recorded media, which does not require live performers for its production in broadcast at concert halls, radio, multi-media, etc. Its creation can include but not limited to acoustic instruments, voice, environmental sources, and computer (Sampling, MAX MSP, MIDI, C Sound, Ableton, Audacity, SuperCollider, Puredata, ProTools, etc.)

All works submitted should be with the understanding that it is their recording that is of prime importance and is what will be used to determine its selection.

60x60 is a project of ""signature works"" and short works created specifically for the 60x60 project. Excerpts of larger works are strongly discouraged. Works generated from procedures (i.e. mathematical matrices, organizational systems, or computer programs,) remixed works, or themes and motives recomposed from other of the composer's own work are acceptable.

The call is open to composers of any age, gender, race, sexual preference, nationality, or career stage.

Deadline for 60 second compositions for 60x60 is June 30th, 2023

The Taishogoto (also known as the Nagoya Harp or Peacock Harp) was developed in the early 20th century. It consists of a course of three (or four) melody strings, which are fretted via a sort of keyboard arrangement, and one (or occasionally two) drone strings. The bridge for the drone string(s) is on a lower level than the melody strings.The melody strings are tuned to G, in octaves. The range of the fretboard is from the G below middle C to the F two octaves higher, plus a high G. The Drone string(s) are tuned to G, an octave lower than the melody strings. The melody strings are normally strummed to play all three strings, although single-string playing is possible, to play only the lower or higher octave. It is not possible to play more than one note at a time on the melody strings.

For this call, no pieces involving alternate tunings will be considered.

Kohl was chosen to premier a new work for the 60th Anniversary of the United Nations held at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. Awarded the UCLA Music Department’s first University Chancellor Fellowship, Kohl did his doctoral work in Systematic Musicology while also holding the position of Conducting Teaching Associate under Samuel Krachmalnick, Leonard Bernstein’s chosen conductor of his original Broadway production of “Candide.” Kohl later also worked with Goffredo Cordietti, Arturo Toscanini’s only conducting assistant. A consummate clarinetist, Kohl has performed chamber music internationally and toured with the San Francisco Symphony. Videos about PCO and Kohl can be seen on our website:

U.S. Navy Band Alton Adams Award for Emerging Composers,01/08/2023 23:59,Online,"The first Black bandmaster in the Navy, Chief Musician Alton Augustus Adams Sr., holds a significant place in the legacy of Navy Music. Adams, a pioneer in his own right, led an all-Black Navy Band during a period of racial segregation. He believed that music in service to our nation could be a catalyst for social change. Reflecting upon his experience while on tour with his band in 1924, Adams said, ""Above all, the tour had a profound and lasting impact upon the minds and attitudes of African Americans, who saw our accomplishments not only as a vindication of the race, but also an opportunity for better treatment and greater equality.""

Those who came before us laid the groundwork for our future, embodying this line of our Sailor’s Creed: “I am committed to excellence and the fair treatment of all.” In this spirit, create a choral work or arrangement up to six minutes in length which celebrates and/or pays homage to female trailblazers.

Open to citizens and legal permanent residents of the United States, ages 18-41 as of Jan. 1, 2023. Those involved in a military music program (active duty, guard or reserve) are not eligible.

Open Call for Artist Residency Spring/Summer 2023,01/09/2023 23:59,Online,"Arts Letters & Numbers was founded in 2011. At that point the summer workshop was the driving force of the organization. When the facilities grew so did the program. In 2015 the first Artist in Residence arrived. Since then we have continuously been cultivating this program to encourage individual and collaborative creation: to think, make and act alongside others within a community. The program has brought together artists from a wide range of disciplines, to ask and engage their questions, create and share their work. When people are free to act, interact with and support one another, new works and ideas emerge.

Arts Letters & Numbers is a place of creative urgency and intensity of purpose, a place to create new linkages, new thought processes, new path- ways of understanding that embody our best hopes and aspirations. It is a place where many elements come together to co-construct questions and works, of empathy, of ethics, of imagination; it is a place to explore the nuanced fragilities in our shared stories.

We are situated within an enthusiastic and supportive community that is highly active in the short term programming of Arts Letters & Numbers, including Events, Courses, and Workshops that run in parallel to and interweave with the Residency Program. To further expand the conversation and space of Arts Letters & Numbers – both within the Residency Program and the broader community – as an Artist in Residence you will be encouraged to participate in and host some of these features, as well as proposing your own events to foster and enrich this dialogue, i.e. lectures, exhibitions, performances, etc.

Artist Residency Spring/Summer 2023,01/09/2023 23:59,Online,"Arts Letters & Numbers was founded in 2011. At that point the summer workshop was the driving force of the organization. When the facilities grew so did the program. In 2015 the first Artist in Residence arrived. Since then we have continuously been cultivating this program to encourage individual and collaborative creation: to think, make and act alongside others within a community. The program has brought together artists from a wide range of disciplines, to ask and engage their questions, create and share their work. When people are free to act, interact with and support one another, new works and ideas emerge.

Arts Letters & Numbers is a place of creative urgency and intensity of purpose, a place to create new linkages, new thought processes, new path- ways of understanding that embody our best hopes and aspirations. It is a place where many elements come together to co-construct questions and works, of empathy, of ethics, of imagination; it is a place to explore the nuanced fragilities in our shared stories.

We are situated within an enthusiastic and supportive community that is highly active in the short term programming of Arts Letters & Numbers, including Events, Courses, and Workshops that run in parallel to and interweave with the Residency Program. To further expand the conversation and space of Arts Letters & Numbers – both within the Residency Program and the broader community – as an Artist in Residence you will be encouraged to participate in and host some of these features, as well as proposing your own events to foster and enrich this dialogue, i.e. lectures, exhibitions, performances, etc.

Open Call Artist Residency Spring/Summer 2023,01/09/2023 23:59,Online,"Arts Letters & Numbers was founded in 2011. At that point the summer workshop was the driving force of the organization. When the facilities grew so did the program. In 2015 the first Artist in Residence arrived. Since then we have continuously been cultivating this program to encourage individual and collaborative creation: to think, make and act alongside others within a community. The program has brought together artists from a wide range of disciplines, to ask and engage their questions, create and share their work. When people are free to act, interact with and support one another, new works and ideas emerge.

Arts Letters & Numbers is a place of creative urgency and intensity of purpose, a place to create new linkages, new thought processes, new path- ways of understanding that embody our best hopes and aspirations. It is a place where many elements come together to co-construct questions and works, of empathy, of ethics, of imagination; it is a place to explore the nuanced fragilities in our shared stories.

We are situated within an enthusiastic and supportive community that is highly active in the short term programming of Arts Letters & Numbers, including Events, Courses, and Workshops that run in parallel to and interweave with the Residency Program. To further expand the conversation and space of Arts Letters & Numbers – both within the Residency Program and the broader community – as an Artist in Residence you will be encouraged to participate in and host some of these features, as well as proposing your own events to foster and enrich this dialogue, i.e. lectures, exhibitions, performances, etc.

The work is first recorded once with entirely open-ended instructions; the only goal is to create the performer’s concept of music. This is then the seed from which the rest of the forest of Silva is grown; the subsequent performers access the database of recordings and choose one of their own to use as a guide for their own performance, and this process is recorded over and over until one thousand such iterations are achieved. By having the database accessible everywhere, such as in the case of Silva, you can witness the transformation of a single seed and the influence of cultures beyond a single local.

VCCA's Artist Residency in Auvillar, France

Moulin à Nef is the name of the VCCA-France facility in Auvillar. It’s composed of three buildings at 16, 17 and 18 Esplanade du Port, the terrace and the hill behind the buildings up to the road that leads to Auvillar. The name Moulin à Nef comes from the floating grain mills that anchored in the current of the Garonne until the early 19th century.

The three buildings are:

La Cloucado – a reference to a celebrated Occitan literary group in Auvillar called “La Cloucado Macabrun”. Others have said it’s Occitan for “hen and chicks”. Ground floor is the office of the Resident Director, with a small apartment upstairs.




La Cebo –  “Onion” in Occitan. This building houses 4 studio spaces. On the ground floor is a large flex space originally set up as a ceramic studio, but used also as artist studio(s), classroom, dining area and theater. Upstairs are three studios suited for visual artists, writers, composers. There is a washroom on each level.




Maison Vieilhescaze – named after the former owner, Pierre Vieilhescaze, this wonderful house dating from the 1600s is the artists’ residency with four bedrooms, kitchen and large dining/living area.

The Leczky brothers of the Kodály String Duo are calling for new compositions to expand the string duo repertoire,None,"Vienna, Austria","The Leczky brothers of the Kodály String Duo are calling for new compositions to expand the string duo repertoire

KSDV-portrait

Sebastian and Marcel Leczky of the Kodály String Duo

With an aim to generate more repertoire for string duo, violinist Sebastian Leczky and cellist Marcel Leczky have formed the Kodály String Duo Vienna Contemporary programme, calling on composers to send scores for the instrumentation.

The brothers, who were born in Vienna and are of Hungarian descent, have taken their ensemble name from composer Zoltán Kodály, whom they state to be their inspiration due to his support for young musicians, as well as the monumental Duo op.7 for the string duo instrumentation.

Acknowledging the dearth of repertoire for string duo, Sebastian tells The Strad ’We know that the string duo genre was not as popular as the string quartet, but we would like to change that.

’Our main goal is to increase the repertoire to the level of other popular chamber music formations. Hopefully many more string duos will be established. The possibilities of a violin and cello together is huge, as composers of the past, like Kodály, Ravel and Glière have written for this formation.’

Composers interested in submitting scores for the Kodály String Duo’s consideration can do so via this Google form:

Born in 2001, Sebastian is currently studying with violinist Ida Bieler at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, where he also attended the Pre-College department under Wladislaw Winokurow. He has also enjoyed musical input from Arkadij Winokurow and Boris Kuschnir. He is winner of the International Vasa Prihoda Competition and since 2019 is supported by the Vienna Philharmonic and Prima la Musica Wien’s young artist talent programme.

Marcel was born in 1999 and is currently studying with Kerstin Feltz at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. He has participated in masterclasses with several prominent cellists, including Wolfgang Emanuel Schmidt, Jens Peter Maintz, Johannes Moser, Miklós Perényi, István Várdai, Reinhard Latzko, Julian Steckel, Emilio Colon and Zlatomir Fung with a special invitation at the Kronberg Academy.

Call for Arrangement Proposals — flourish! new music ensemble,None,"Tucson, Arizona, United States","We are flourish! new music ensemble and we based in Tucson, Arizona. We're five friends who eat, drink, laugh, and play together, and we're working on sparking joy in new music. We are putting out a call for arrangement proposals for ensemble comprising oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon and harp.

As an ensemble, we believe in equitable treatment of composers and other music creators. This is NOT a call for scores, and we ask that you do not write a new piece of music for us for free. We understand that composition is work, and we believe that composers and other music makes should be compensated for their work. 

We also understand is that part of being a person who writes music is having projects that don't go anywhere. Sometimes a piece falls through, or you wrote something for a contest and it didn't win, or you wrote something for a degree and it only got one performance and the recording sucks. We see an opportunity here to give these kinds of works new life and to provide composers and other music creators with useful, high quality documentation of their work. We can't afford to pay you to create new work (and we strongly encourage you not to write new works for free), but we can provide you with professional audio and video recordings of your work in exchange for the work of arranging for our instrumentation. 

flourish! is looking for works that inspire, include, or embody joy. We do not play traumatic music, and our audiences do not come to flourish! performances expecting to have to deal with tragedy and pain. We are only interested in music that is fun, beautiful, honest, passionate, authentic, and playful. We typically like everyone in the ensemble to perform every piece and are not looking for music that utilizes subsets of our instrumentation. We value inclusivity, visibility, and accessibility in our programming and will prioritize working with composers who have something unheard to say. 

There is no fee for entering this call for arrangement proposals and you may submit any number of works. We typically prioritize composers and other music makers born after 1980, but we are open to music of any style by anyone. This call for arrangement proposals will remain open indefinitely. 

Here's how this works:

You (the person who writes music) will fill out this form, and flourish! will review your submission. If we say yes, we will ask you to create an arrangement of the submitted work and we will create documentation of your work at our next available opportunity. We may ask for revisions or modifications based on the results of our rehearsals. If we say no, we will provide you specific feedback as to why we believe your work is not a good fit for us and encourage you to apply again with another work. 

Please DO NOT arrange your work unless we decide that we want each work you submit to be part of our repertoire. The last thing we want you to do is preemptively do work you should be compensated for without the guarantee of being it being performed and documented. 

flourish! new music ensemble has access to the following instruments:




Oboe, Oboe d'Amore, and/or English Horn




Clarinet in Bb, Clarinet in A, and/or Bass Clarinet




Alto and/or Tenor Saxophone
