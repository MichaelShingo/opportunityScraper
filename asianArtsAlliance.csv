Call for Participants: “Anonymous Was the Data”,None,Online,"The Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab at Princeton University hosts an art project directed by Artist-in-Residence, Chanika Svetvilas that launches Fall 2022. “Anonymous was the Data” looks at mental health and healthcare needs of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). It does this through a voluntary survey of AAPI who acknowledge within themselves a mental health difference. The survey questions explore the relationship between mental health difference and healthcare access. Suicide is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans ages 15-24 and Asian American women ages 64+. Racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination can have traumatic impact from generation to generation. Systemic barriers can include lack of access to health insurance and money for co-pays, lack of transportation, and lack of healthcare providers that understand their experience. Each data set collected from the survey will be mapped onto a physical characteristic such as a bubble or twist, which will then, using a 3D printer, be digitized to print as distorted prescription bottles. Collectively, these pieces will fit together as a puzzle and will be available for participants to assemble.“The goal of Anonymous was the Data is for the audience to see mental health data in a new way and apply the information to their locality and personal experience.” 

The data collected is individualized and handled with care and resources of support instead of generic clinical statistics. Svetvilas is working with an advisory committee and research associates at the Ida B. Wells Lab. The project will culminate with an interactive installation at the Lewis Center for the Arts, Princeton University in September 2023 and will include a workshop, artist talk, and panel discussion.

“Daly City” is an autobiographical story that examines themes of exoticism, assimilation and the model minority myth, through a clever and playful tale about an Indonesian boy and his mother who pretend that Chinese takeout is actually a traditional family dish at a potluck in order to impress the largely white church community. The boy’s mother teaches him how to “play the game” - how to maneuver, perform and captivate in order to gain acceptance.

This is a paid opportunity.

LOGLINE:Fremont, CA. 2008. In the last month of summer before high school begins, an impressionable thirteen-year-old Taiwanese American boy learns what his family can’t teach him: how to skate, how to flirt and how to love your mom.

NO ACTING EXPERIENCE NECESSARY

ROLES

CHRIS WANG, aka WANG-WANG, Male (11-14) - Chinese / Taiwanese American – Impressionable, angsty, and charmingly bracefaced. Manga enthusiast, amateur cameraperson, and fledgling skate nerd. Wrestles with a complex inner sense of identity that he can’t fully comprehend yet: too Asian for the white kids, too white for the Asian kids.

Must be able to speak conversational Mandarin. Skateboarding experience a plus.

FAHAD MAHMOOD, Male (11-14) - South Asian American – Charismatic, lovable, young brown casanova (or so-he-thinks). A natural storyteller. Comes from a religious family, but Dave Chapelle, Russell Peters, and Kevjumba are his Gods. Cares about two things and two things only: staying fresh & mackin’ on girls.

JIMMY KIM - aka SOUP, Male (11-14) - Korean American – Loudmouth, no-filter goofball. Lives on a healthy diet of kimchi-jjigae, Monster energy, and underground hip-hop: Blue Scholars, Atmosphere, Nujabes are the soundtracks to his life. A loose cannon of untamed emotion. Gochujang on everything, DGAF about nothin’.

CHUNGSING, Female (40 - 60) - Chinese/Taiwanese American – Empathetic, artistic, and resilient. Exudes a motherly warmth. A youthful spirit, her age shown only by the wrinkles in her skin and graying hair. Capable of anger but suppresses it well. A Taiwanese immigrant and stay-at-home mother – the nature of which left her to poorly assimilate to “American” ways of life.

Must be able to speak fluent Mandarin

NAI NAI, Female (75 - 90) - Chinese/Taiwanese American –Skeletal face. Skin spotted with age. A round ball of Asian energy. Strong-headed and witty. Young enough to argue her point, old enough to not care if she’s wrong. Loves her Chinese talk shows and Mahjong Tuesdays. Slippers in the house, always.

Must be able to speak fluent Mandarin

VIVIAN, Female (16 - 22) - Chinese/Taiwanese American – Precocious. Booksmart. Attending UCSD in the Fall. Bright and independent, but wrestles with low self-esteem due to her constant eczema flare-ups, especially in the summer heat. Constantly bickering with Wang-Wang, but loves him deep down, even if she can’t admit it.

DONOVAN, Male (16 - 25) – all ethnicities – hometown hero & hustler with a heart of gold. Looks for every chance to make some change: odd jobs, charging gas money, slanging shoes, etc. Would rather earn one dollar than steal ten. Wants to be sponsored.

Must know how to skateboard

NUGGET, Male (14 - 20) – all ethnicities –Happy-go-lucky skate rat. Showers once a week. Radiates positivity – never not smiling.

Must know how to skateboard

CORY, Male (16 - 22) – all ethnicities –Seemingly standoffish, but just shy and awkward. The only one of the group still in school. The worst skater of the 3, but skates less now anyways because he’s studying for the SATs – wants to go to Berkeley.

Must know how to skateboard

MADI, Female (13 - 18) Hapa. Ambitious & driven. Band geek & secret Maplestory nerd. Wang-Wang’s crush. A high school Freshman – not much older than Wang-Wang, but at that age, one grade is an eternity.

JADE, Female (12 - 18) – all ethnicities – Bold, sassy, smart & stylish. 4.0 Honors student from the sister school. Into streetwear and raw denim. Wears Stüssy on picture day.

ELLIE, Female (12 - 18) – all ethnicities – Jade’s “best friend” and/or underling. Observant, always putting on. Nicer than she seems. Shier than she acts.

JOSH, Male (15 - 20) – East Asian American – Academic. Athletic. Awkward. A try-hard, but Asian excellence in all the ways his mother would want.

Miss Saigon Casting Call,05/02/2023 23:59,Online,"The White Plains Performing Arts Center is seeking both AEA & non-union performers for Miss Saigon . We are seeking a MULTI-ETHNIC cast with fantastic singing, acting and dancing abilities to play principal and supporting roles (breakdown below).

Please note there is NO housing for this production. The theater is located 35 min from NYC via train or car.

SYNOPSIS

Miss Saigon is an epic, stunning adaptation of Puccini’s opera, Madame Butterfly, by the writers behind Les Miserables. Reframing Puccini’s story by setting it during the Vietnam War, Miss Saigon is a powerful and poignant tale of love in a war-torn country. In the dangerous days before Saigon’s fall in 1975, Chris (an American GI) and Kim (a destitute Vietnamese orphan working her first night as a prostitute) fall in love. When the city falls, the lovers are forced apart, and each must find their own way, alone. When, years later, Chris is able to return to Vietnam, he brings with him an American wife. Kim, who has waited for Chris, has raised their son, Tam, who is “bui-doi”– a term for a child conceived during the horrors of war. With so much devastation behind them, Kim and Chris must decide how to move forward. Miss Saigon is a tragedy of massive proportions: passionate, profound, and heart-wrenchingly honest. With a sung-through score and tour-de-force roles for actors, Miss Saigon is a theatrical experience that will stay with you for years to come.

About Washington Project for the Arts 

Unique among arts organizations, Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) supports artist-driven projects, advocacy, and dialogue so that artists can live, work, and flourish. Artists curate and organize all WPA programming as an extension of their own intellectual research and in alignment with WPA values of collaboration, inclusion, and experimentation.

WPA’s support for artist-driven projects is based on the belief that a thriving arts community is essential to the enduring health of society, and a vision for the nation’s capital as a place that welcomes, values, and respects the presence and contributions of contemporary artists.

WPA values artists and pays artists. Its commitment to paying artists fairly made it the first arts organization between New York and Miami to be W.A.G.E. (Working Artists for the Greater Economy) certified in 2016. In 2020, 50% of WPA expenses went directly to artists. 

WPA was founded in 1975 by the art impresario Alice Denney, organizer of the legendary NOW Festival in 1966. Over the past four decades, and under the leadership of a series of dynamic directors, WPA has been at the nexus of the Washington, DC area arts community, presenting exhibitions, lectures, screenings, performances, workshops, symposia, and public art projects. Nearly every major visual artist in the District between 1975 and today has had some connection with WPA; many have sat on WPA’s Board of Directors, including William Christenberry, Gene Davis, Sherman Fleming, Sam Gilliam, Martha Jackson-Jarvis, and Maida Withers. Walter Hopps, the legendary curator, was also a board member.

WPA’s artist-driven program model was adopted in 2018 after extensive interviews with artists in the greater Washington, DC area. To learn more about WPA, please visit www.wpadc.org.

Leadership Overview

WPA has created a unique program model and organizational structure that inspires other arts organizations to be more collaborative when supporting artists.

Director of Development - Folger Shakespeare Library,None,"Washington, Washington, United States","Organization

A hub for scholarship, performance, and the study of the early modern period, the Folger Shakespeare Library (Folger) puts Shakespeare and the period in which he lived in dialogue with a changing world. In advancing its mission, the Folger connects with 21stcentury audiences through programming and research inspired by a renowned collection of rare books, manuscripts, and other materials. The Folger creates lovers of Shakespeare and the humanities through programs that speak directly and powerfully to the human experience. Driving discovery and creating transformative experiences for students of all ages, the Folger is a leader in performance-based education, and more than two million teachers and students benefit from its broad variety of programs, exhibits, and events each year.

The Folger’s founders, Henry Clay and Emily Jordan Folger established the institution in 1932. The Folger is a world-class research center on Shakespeare and the early modern western world. The historic landmark building, designed in 1932 by Paul Cret, is undergoing a multiyear, $80-million-dollar renovation expanding public space, improving accessibility, and enhancing engagement for all visitors including a 12,000 square-foot New Pavilion that will feature new exhibition space and visitor amenities. The expanded Folger building promises a dramatically different relationship with new and existing audiences: teachers/educators, families, daytime visitors, members, academics, researchers, and scholars, general enthusiasts, and local/national/global institutional partners and funders.

What Can We Do?,20/02/2023 23:59,"New York City, New York, United States","What Can We Do? (WCWD?), presented by the Asian American Arts Alliance (A4), is a micro-grant opportunity for artists looking to support the AAPI community in NYC with engaging, creative projects rooted in care. Honoring the power of art as healing, WCWD? invites artists with a desire to affect change in their communities to carry out a project in a three-month period (March 1-May 15, 2023).

The lingering effects of the twin pandemics of COVID and anti-Asian hate continue to be felt today. In response, many mutual aid groups, direct service organizations, and community and business leaders have stepped in to take care of elders and other vulnerable AAPI community members across the city.

WCWD? gives artists a chance to find their place in the care ecosystem either by complementing existing services and offerings, or creating their own.

PROGRAM GOALS

For this program, 30 NYC-based artists will be selected as project awardees by a random draw. They will each receive $500 to create and carry out ideas to engage, aid, and care for the Asian New Yorker community with a focus on Chinatown, Manhattan and Flushing, Queens.

Projects may take many forms such as performing music for seniors waiting in line at food pantries or leading workshops to create ‘zines that reinforce positive aspects of AAPI culture. While we prefer projects to be in-person activities, we understand that for safety reasons, projects may need to be virtual. You can review past projects here.

Matchmaking with Community Organizations

In the application, we ask artists to share a project idea and a community or community organization you would like to work with and/or serve through your project.

If you are selected, there is flexibility in updating the project idea and/or community if circumstances require. Any updates will need to be communicated to A4.

If you are selected, A4 is happy to facilitate an introduction to a pre-approved community-based organization in either Chinatown, Manhattan or Flushing, Queens. 

These 10+ organizations (listed below) have already agreed to being matched with an artist for a project. Should you be interested in being matched, there is a place in the application where you can select your top three organizations. Please note that there is no guarantee that you will be matched with an organization; we will try our best.

Chinatown, Manhattan



Think!Chinatown – An intergenerational non-profit based in Manhattan’s Chinatown, working at the intersection of storytelling, arts & neighborhood engagement.

Send Chinatown Love – A digital community for Chinatown’s restaurants to sustain themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. In short, Send Chinatown Love gives merchants an online platform who otherwise wouldn’t have one.

Mencius Society for the Arts – The organization’s mission is inspired by the teachings of Mengzi (better known as “Mencius“ in the west), a Chinese philosopher who believed in the notion of personal cultivation and social contract. With focus on the Chinese tradition (though by no means exclusively) Mencius seeks to enhance public awareness of classical and folk cultures and to promote personal and social benefits that are derived from learning and from disciplined pursuits. In performing arts, Mencius presents concerts, festivals and workshops under the banner of EastRiver Ensemble and EastRiver Arts Center.

Charles B. Wang Community Health Center – A federally qualified health center offering comprehensive primary care services to all, regardless of their ability to pay, their language, or their immigration history.



Flushing, Queens



Nan Shan Senior Center – The Nan Shan Senior Center in Flushing provides seniors ages 60+ with lunch, ESL classes, culture and art programs, education, health management, exercise classes as well as health and nutrition seminars and case assistance.

Undo Poverty Flushing – The group’s mission is to help move all Flushing community members out of poverty toward sustainable economic advancement using a community-informed and driven approach. The initiative is funded by the Robin Hood Foundation and is anchored by CPC and includes key collaborative partners AAFE, MinKwon, Queens Public Library, The Child Center of NY, and River Fund.

Korean Community Services of New York – Founded in 1973, Korean Community Services of Metropolitan New York, Inc (KCS) is the oldest and largest 501©(3) nonprofit organization assisting Korean-Americans and other immigrant communities in the greater New York City area with economic empowerment, social well-being, and health and wellness. KCS envisions a world where immigrant communities remain grounded in their heritage and work together with the broader community to build a better society at large.

Lewis Latimer House – The Lewis H. Latimer Fund, Inc. was established to preserve and promote the legacy of Lewis Howard Latimer, and other innovators of color who made extraordinary contributions to technology and American life. The Museum offers STEAM educational programs, exhibitions and public programs in poetry, arts, technology, and social justice. Latimer’s life story is used as a point of departure from which to examine issues of race, class, immigration and contemporary events. 

Red Canary Song – Red Canary Song is a grassroots massage worker coalition in the U.S. There are over 9000 workplaces like these across the country with no political representation, or access to labor rights or collective organizing. Anti-trafficking NGO’s that claim to speak for migrants in sex trades promote increased policing and immigration control, which harms rather than helps migrant sex workers. We also organize transnationally with Asian sex workers across the diaspora in Toronto, Paris, and Hong Kong.

YWCA Queens – The YWCA of Queens was created by the Queens community, for the Queens community and, in continuation of our legacy, strives to be of the Queens community.

Queens Botanical Garden – Queens Botanical Garden is an urban oasis where people, plants and cultures are celebrated through inspiring gardens, innovative educational programs and demonstrations of environmental stewardship. The vision of the Queens Botanical Garden’s programming is to be a leading cultural, educational, and environmental resource that reflects the diversity of our audiences in an accessible and welcoming way, and that celebrates nature, arts, culture and the history of our community in this unique garden setting.

Flushing Town Hall – The mission of Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts (FCCA) is to present multi-disciplinary global arts that engage and educate the global communities of Queens, New York and New York City, New York, in order to foster mutual appreciation.

FAQ

The following questions were submitted during the information session. If you have a question that is not answered below, please email Justine Lee at jlee@aaartsalliance.org.

Could book publishers submit on behalf of their authors?

Yes, as long as each application includes different contact information for each author, and A4 can be working directly with the author if they are selected.

Does the applicant’s location affect the chance for being selected?

As long as the applicant resides in NYC, they are eligible. If you reside in a neighborhood other than Flushing, Queens or Chinatown, Manhattan then your project idea must affect communities living in Chinatown, Manhattan, and Flushing, Queens.

Do you have to provide proof or documentation that you are a practicing artist?

We consider resumes that capture your body of work over time (projects, shows, collaborations, etc.) proof that you are a practicing artist.

What if experience on my resume does not show that I am a practicing artist?

We are willing to be flexible on what we consider a practicing artist; you need not be a full-time or professional artist to be eligible for this opportunity. As long as you practice art and creativity in some capacity and have a creative project you would like to carry out for the community, you are eligible.

Do you have Japanese organizations to match artists with? And should the Japanese organizations be in either in District 1 Manhattan or Flushing if the artist doesn’t live in those areas?

At the moment, we do not have Japanese-specific organizations to match artists with. If you have an organization in mind, please indicate what organization you plan to work with in your application. If your project affects communities living in Chinatown, Manhattan or Flushing, Queens, you do not need to reside in either neighborhood. However, if your project more broadly benefits the NYC AAPI community, and not those specific neighborhoods, you are required to reside in or be from Chinatown or Flushing. It’s either/or/both.

How many projects will be selected?

30 artists will be selected, and the total number of projects granted $500 depends on that.

If I have a project in mind that would be a collaboration, should only one person apply?

You should apply as one person and mention that you will work with a collaborator.

Can translation, language justice, and community organizing count as an art practice?

Yes, the goal of this project is to engage the community, and language justice or translation help for your community counts.

Why random drawing? Since the selection is a drawing, how do we strengthen our application?

Random drawing provides a more equal opportunity for artists who might not typically receive awards based on merit. Random drawing is also an easier lift for A4 while selecting as many artists as possible and supplying them with a meaningful cash award. There is not really a way to strengthen your application as long as you make sure your application shows that you are eligible, such as making sure your project shows care to the community.

Production Manager- South Coast Repertory,None,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Organization

South Coast Repertory (SCR) was founded on the belief that theatre has the unique power to illuminate the human experience. SCR is committed to exploring urgent human and social issues of this time, and to blending literature, design and performance in ways that test the bounds of theatre’s artistic possibilities. It advances the art of theatre in service of its community and aims to extend that service through educational, intercultural, and community engagement programs that harmonize with its artistic mission. 

Founded in 1964 by Martin Benson and David Emmes, SCR is led by Artistic Director David Ivers and Managing Director Paula Tomei. SCR produces year-round on three stages, the 507-seat Segerstrom Stage, 336-seat Julianne Argyros Stage, and 94-seat Nicholas Studio. The productions, including annual holiday favorite A Christmas Carol and a Theatre for Young Audiences and Families offering, meet the highest standards of artistic and literary excellence. As of this writing, SCR has realized 541 full productions in 58 seasons including 157 world premieres, 91 of which were plays commissioned by SCR. With a history of nurturing long-term collaborations with gifted playwrights, more than 30% of the repertoire are new plays. 

Responding to the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, SCR introduced Outside SCR, which features fully staged, family-friendly productions outdoors at the historic Mission San Juan Capistrano each summer. Through an integrated, multi-initiative play-development program known as The Lab@SCR, South Coast Repertory commissions playwrights at various stages of their careers, develops new work through in-house readings and workshops, and is committed to the development of new American musicals. The centerpiece of The Lab@SCR is The Pacific Playwrights Festival which annually showcases seven new plays, a combination of readings and full productions, over a three-day weekend. 

SCR also serves the community and the field through an on-site Theatre Conservatory, offering a wide array of year-round acting classes. Along with other education and outreach programming, the Conservatory serves students of all ages. The Junior, Teen, and Summer Players—advanced students in the Youth Conservatory, are featured in three productions annually. 

South Coast Repertory is governed by a 27-member Board of Trustees, led by President J. Steven Duncan. David Ivers has served as Artistic Director since 2019. In 1988, SCR received a Tony® Award for distinguished achievement. It operates under an agreement between the League of Resident Theatres (LORT), Actors’ Equity Association, the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society and United Scenic Artists, the union of scenic, costume, lighting, and sound designers. For the 2023 fiscal year, SCR adopted a $11.7 million dollar budget, with 31% of revenue derived from ticket sales and conservatory tuitions, 26% from contributions and grants, and the remaining 43% from other revenues including endowment earnings and reserve allocations derived from special government funding due to COVID-19.

Community

Costa Mesa offers rich history, growing neighborhoods, and world-renown arts and culture offerings all only one mile from the Pacific Ocean. Since its incorporation in 1953, the city has grown from a semi-rural farming community of 16,000 to a thriving, urban-suburban mix locale with a population of almost 110,000 in 2022. Located on the coastal tableland above Newport Beach, Costa Mesa’s first inhabitants were native American Indians who settled on the mesa near the banks of the Santa Ana River. The city is nestled in the heart of Orange County, just 37 miles south of Los Angeles and 88 miles north of San Diego. 

Known as the “City of the Arts,” Costa Mesa is also home to Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Pacific Symphony, Orange County Museum of Art, Costa Mesa Playhouse, and the 1.6-acre Noguchi Sculpture Gardens. Costa Mesa’s nonprofit arts organizations generate $110 million in revenue and the total economic impact of these organizations is $521 million. The City of Costa Mesa Cultural Arts Committee is an appointed volunteer group that works with City Council to establish ongoing programs, community events and useful information that helps residents access the arts in many different venues, and through multiple sources. 

Costa Mesa is one of the region’s largest commercial areas, with an economy based on luxury retail, commerce, and light manufacturing. The largest center of commercial activity is South Coast Plaza, a shopping center noted for its architecture and size. The volume of sales generated by South Coast Plaza, on the strength of its more than 270 stores, places it among the highest volume regional shopping centers in the nation. South Coast Metro is a commercial, cultural, and residential district surrounding South Coast Plaza. Some manufacturing activity also takes place in the city, mostly in the industrial, southwestern quarter, which is home to a number of electronics and pharmaceutical firms. Business services company Experian is the largest employer in the city. As the capital of the action sports industry, many related companies make their corporate home here, including Hurley, RVCA, Vans and Volcom. 

With famously mild temperatures and nearly year-round sunshine, Costa Mesa is a haven for outdoor adventure. There are many impressive cycling and hiking trails, a municipal golf course, and the Huntington Beach and Newport Beach are just minutes away. There are 26 local parks, including Talbert Regional Park which has nearly 200 acres of scenic landscape great for hiking, biking, or jogging and serves as a botanical garden and a wildlife refuge. The city is convenient to many transportation options including the bus and shuttle service and in close proximity to the 405 freeway, an Amtrak stop, and the John Wayne Airport, which is less than five miles away. Costa Mesa schools are highly rated, and the city is home to many education institutions including Vanguard University, Orange Coast College, and University of California, Irvine which is just minutes away.

Director - Center for Creative Photography,None,"Phoenix, Arizona, United States","Organization

The Center for Creative Photography (CCP/The Center) at the University of Arizona (Tucson) is the premier research collection of American photographic fine art and archives, promoting creative inquiry, dialogue, and appreciation of photography’s enduring cultural influence. Established in 1975, CCP’s collections include some of the most recognizable names in 20th-century North American photography: Ansel Adams, Richard Avedon, Louis Carlos Bernal, Benjamen Chinn, Aaron Siskind, W. Eugene Smith, Lola Álvarez Bravo, Edward Weston, and Garry Winogrand. CCP’s collections, combined with its experienced staff, provide an unparalleled resource for students, educators, scholars, museums, publishers, and the public. Located on the University of Arizona campus, CCP’s public galleries, auditorium, print viewing room, research study center, conservation laboratory, and ancillary facilities support an active program of academic engagement, interdisciplinary research, community collaboration, preservation, exhibitions, publications, and loans to museums worldwide. CCP, with a designated gallery, partners with the Phoenix Art Museum and has a loan program with other venues worldwide to present CCP’s vibrant photography works to the broader community.

CCP has a large interdisciplinary research collection—which includes an archive of nearly 300 collections and a fine print collection numbering about 100,000 prints supported by a reference library—and an oral history collection. These works can be referenced in person and through various digital means. The Center is actively working on programmatic and user-driven digitization efforts and a technology plan which will serve to increase the accessibility of the collections. There are over 8 million objects in CCP’s archival collections, including photographic materials, letters, manuscripts, publications, unique artifacts, oral histories, and audiovisual recordings (available digitally through the Center’s Aviary instance). CCP also maintains an ArchivesSpace Instance which serves to describe the creation, content, context, and arrangement of the archival collection materials, enabling users to identify and request materials relevant to their research. For the fine print collection, a related platform CollectionsSpace is currently being implemented to provide similar digital services for the fine print collection which began at the institution’s founding, in part by a gift of the personal collections of the five founding archive artists and has continued to grow.

CCP is part of Arizona Arts, a university division that presents a unified gateway to the unique visual and performing arts assets, experiences, and educational programs, including the College of Fine Arts, on the University of Arizona campus. CCP, the University of Arizona Museum of Art, and Arizona Arts Live constitute the presenting and engagement units within the division. Leading the division, Andrew Schulz serves as the Vice President for the Arts and Dean of the College of Fine Arts. The Arizona Arts Master Plan is a significant part of the Arizona Advantage pillar of the University’s strategic plan, with a commitment to “integrate arts throughout the University experience and beyond.” CCP’s core values are Legacy, Integrity, Collaboration, Diversity, Stewardship, Learning, and Access.CCP has a staff of 31 full, part-time, and student team members and an annual operating budget of $3M.

Digital Diasporas Residency,15/02/2023 23:59,"Philadelphia, United States","About Digital Diasporas

In 2021 we launched the first iteration of the Digital Diasporas, a distributed, remote residency which gave artists the space to research, cultivate their practice, and convene across borders. Last year’s residents Tian Zhang, Amy Lam, and Casey Tang inspired many generative conversations and long-lasting connections about colonialisms in multiple contexts, sustainability and equity in arts practices, and all the ways in which we (human, non-human, and ecological) coexist in all our relations.

Digital Diasporas was a spacious opportunity for artists to do deep thinking and form cross-border connections without the pressure of producing a final product. This year, we are excited to bring back this open call for a second iteration with an additional residency host in the United States.

What we are looking for

We want to hear from artists, collectives, and curators who self-identify and find it useful to gather under a “Sino and/or Chinese diaspora” cohort. This is a time for research, exploration and learning. We are looking for openness to collective, intercultural and cross-border development and research.

We welcome experimental, digital, and/or research-based practices, and people who feel an alignment with and interest in any or all of the host organizations’ networks and programming. We’re especially interested in ideas that explore diasporic cultures and spaces, flows of people, goods and capital, alternative community and kin-making, digital cultures, media arts, philosophies of technology and place-making—and any intersections of these.

About the residency and hosts

The remote, six-week-long online residency will be facilitated by three host organizations in May and June. Each resident or collective will primarily work with one host organization in Australia, Canada, or the United States and all residents as a cohort will be in dialogue with one another through convenings. Each resident or collective will be awarded an unrestricted stipend of AUD $10,000 for their participation (CAD $10,000 for the Gendai Resident). Each host organization will design a program of remote/online mentoring, networking, research and development for the resident they host. The host organizations are:



4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art (Sydney, Australia / the ancestral lands of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation)

Gendai (Toronto, Canada / the ancestral territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples)

Asian Arts Initiative (Philadelphia, USA / ancestral homelands of the Lenape peoples)



This Digital Diasporas Global Residencies is initiated and funded by the Australian Council for the Arts, and supported by the National Foundation for Australia-China Relations, and Canada Council for the Arts.

For more information about the open call, check out our website:https://yaocollaborative.org/digital-diasporas-open-call Please never hesitate to contact us directly with questions or to recommend specific artists you may have in mind at hello@yaocollaborative.org.

Requirements

Everyone is encouraged to apply, especially if you have never applied to anything in the past. We are particularly interested in applications that resist and interrogate stereotypical or reactionary impulses, instead turning our gaze towards the difficult but necessary conversations, care, and solidarities we might build across borders.

Digital Diasporas will host:



one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino diaspora in or from Australia (citizen or permanent resident)

one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino diaspora in or from Canada (citizen or permanent resident)

one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino, regardless of what passport they hold or where they reside

BACKGROUND

The Fisher Center at Bard develops, produces, and presents performing arts across disciplines through new productions and context-rich programs that challenge and inspire. At once a premier professional performing arts center and a hub for research and education, The Fisher Center supports artists, students, and audiences in the development and exploration of artistic ideas and perspectives from the past, present, and future.

Designed by architect Frank Gehry and opened in 2003, The Fisher Center is the most ambitious capital project in Bard’s history, and embodies the College’s commitment to the arts as a cultural and educational necessity. The Center presents more than 200 world-class events and welcomes 50,000 visitors each year. It supports artists at all stages of their careers and employs more than 300 professional artists annually.

The Fisher Center is a powerful catalyst of art-making regionally, nationally, and worldwide, with a strong emphasis on development, research, innovation, and rediscovery. Every year, the Fisher Center produces eight to 10 major new works across disciplines, including opera, classical music, theater, dance, performance art, and cabaret. Over the past ten years, its commissioned productions have been seen in more than 100 communities and at leading arts centers around the world. In 2019, The Fisher Center won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical for Daniel Fish’s production of Oklahoma! which began life in 2007 as an undergraduate production at Bard and was produced professionally in The Fisher Center’s SummerScape Festival in 2015 before transferring to New York City.

The Fisher Center houses two theaters: Sosnoff Theater, which seats approximately 800 people and features a proscenium stage with a concert shell insert that accommodates opera, music, dance, and theater; and LUMA Theater, a fully flexible venue which seats up to 200 people. The Fisher Center also comprises rehearsal studios, production facilities, offices, and alternative performance spaces. In the summer, The Fisher Center operates the Spiegeltent, a freestanding cabaret venue which has delighted SummerScape audiences for more than a decade.

In October 2022 Bard announced that Maya Lin has been chosen to design a new performing arts studio building for The Fisher Center, in partnership with architects Bialosky and Partners and theater and acoustic consultants Charcoalblue. Situated in meadows to the west of the Fisher Center and overlooking woodlands and the Catskill mountains, the building will provide a home for Fisher Center LAB, the center’s acclaimed residency and commissioning program for professional artists. It will also house rehearsal and teaching facilities for Bard’s undergraduate programs in Dance and in Theater and Performance. The 25,000-square-foot building will contain five state-of-the-art studios for artist residencies, rehearsals, informal performances, and dance and theater classes, which will be connected by gathering hubs. It will function as a laboratory for the performing arts, where students and professional artists work side by side, informing each other’s practices and sharing their discoveries and works-in-progress with audiences from the Bard community and the public. Groundbreaking for the $42 million studio building will take place in 2023, during the celebration of The Fisher Center’s 20th anniversary. Once completed, the building will expand The Fisher Center’s identity beyond the walls of Gehry’s stunning landmark, to become a cultural campus comprising both the Gehry and Lin buildings.

The Fisher Center offers outstanding programs to many communities, including the students and faculty of Bard, and audiences in the Hudson Valley, New York City, across the country, and around the world. The Center’s major professional programs include:

-Bard SummerScape – One of the most ambitious and highly anticipated performing arts festivals in the country. In July and August, SummerScape comprises the annual Bard Music Festival (BMF), now in its 34th year, and seven weeks of opera, dance, music, theater, cabaret, and film. SummerScape has been acclaimed by London’s Times Literary Supplement as “the most intellectually ambitious of America’s summer music festivals” and described by the International Herald Tribune as “seven weeks of cultural delight.”

-Fisher Center LAB – The Fisher Center’s artist residency and commissioning program, provides custom-made and meaningful support for innovative artists across disciplines. Since its launch in 2012, LAB has supported residencies, workshops, and performances for hundreds of artists, incubating new projects and engaging audiences, students, faculty, and staff in the process of creating contemporary performances. LAB strives to provide artists with the environment, resources, and funding they need to experiment, dream, and fully realize their artistic potential. Where possible, Fisher Center LAB builds long-term relationships for artists, powering their work by taking on administrative and producing support of their practices and companies. Productions developed by Fisher Center LAB often premiere in the annual Bard SummerScape festival and frequently tour around the country and across the world. Artists currently under commission from Fisher Center LAB include Pam Tanowitz, Suzan-Lori Parks, Lileana Blain-Cruz, SITI Company, Justin Vivian Bond and Anthony Roth Costanzo, Raja Feather Kelly, Paul Soileau, Beth Gill, Justin Peck, and Daaimah Mubashshir.

The Fisher Center is also home to the Dance and Theater and Performance Programs in Bard’s undergraduate Division of the Arts, and works closely with the Conservatory of Music, The Orchestra Now, and the Vocal Arts Program, among other excellent and diverse arts programs at Bard.

Director (Artistic Producing)- Soho Rep,None,"New York City, New York, United States","Organization

Founded in 1975, Soho Rep provides radical theater makers with productions of the highest caliber and tailor-made development at key junctures in their artistic practice. The organization elevates artists as thought leaders and citizens who change the field and society. Artistic autonomy is paramount at Soho Rep; the organization encourages an unmediated connection between artists and audiences to create a springboard for transformation and rich civic life beyond the walls of its theater.

Soho Rep is committed to the following Core Values:

§We re-center the narratives of people who are underrepresented in our field. We interrogate the history and form of Theater and ask why and for whom Theater exists.

§We prioritize open access to our work. We keep tickets affordable, build two-way coalitions and partnerships across New York City, and continually invite new audiences to our shows.

§The sustainability of Soho Rep is directly tied to the individuals at the heart of our theater. We provide holistic support and fair pay. We are clear-sighted about our organizational capacity, which generates a more reasonable workload for all. We make ambitious and destabilizing theater, which demands even greater diligence to create a nurturing and supportive environment. 

In 2019, Soho Rep established a three-way Co-Directorship, shared leadership model that redistributes power, is more collaborative, and gives equal weight to divergent perspectives. In 2023, Soho Rep Directors Sarah Benson and Meropi Peponides will step down, making way for two new artistic leaders. Director Cynthia Flowers will continue to partner with the two new incoming Directors. The 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons have been programmed by the current Co-Director team to help ensure a thorough and thoughtful transition process. 

Located in Lower Manhattan, at its intimate 65-seat theater, critics have consistently heralded the Off-Broadway company as a go-to theater destination for new and original works. New York Magazine said of the company, “this indispensable theater offers more excitement per chair than any space in town.” Time Out New York called Soho Rep “the best theater in NYC,“ and The New York Times described Soho Rep as ""form-twisting, boundary-breaking, and acclaimed,” adding that, “The downtown powerhouse…regularly outclasses the work done on many of the city’s larger stages.” The Village Voice named Soho Rep the “Best Off-Broadway Theater Company,” and the company was listed in Travel Magazine’s “10 Essential Off-Broadway Theaters.”

Soho Rep has also been honored with a Drama Desk Award for Sustained Achievement. Over the last decade, Soho Rep productions have garnered 21 OBIE Awards; the 2016 Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Musical; 13 Drama Desk nominations; two Kesselring Awards; The New York Times Outstanding Playwriting Award for Dan LeFranc’s Sixty Miles To Silverlake; and a special citation in The New York Drama Critics’ Circle’s 2012-13 awards. Jackie Sibblies Drury’s Fairview, commissioned by Soho Rep and Berkeley Repertory Theatre, won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. In recent years, Soho Rep has presented plays by established and emerging theater artists such as David Adjmi, César Alvarez, Zawe Ashton, Annie Baker, Alice Birch, Christopher Chen, Jackie Sibblies Drury, debbie tucker green, Aleshea Harris, Lucas Hnath, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Daniel Alexander Jones, Hansol Jung, Richard Maxwell, Julia Mounsey, Sarah Kane, Young Jean Lee, Nature Theater of Oklahoma, Kate Tarker, Mara Vélez Meléndez, and Anne Washburn and directors Saheem Ali, Lileana Blain-Cruz, Will Davis, Leah C. Gardiner, Taibi Magar, David Mendizábal, Rebecca Taichman, Eric Ting, Peter Mills Weiss, Dustin Wills, and Whitney White.

The 2022-23 season includes three world premiere commissions: Kate Tarker’s Montag, Shayok Misha Chowdhury’s Public Obscenities, and Jillian Walker’s The Whitney Album. Additionally, a small cohort of commissioned artists whose work is in development will be in conversation with new leadership. In addition to its season of three productions, Soho Rep’s artistic programs include: The Writer Director Lab, Studio, and Project Number One.

Meaningful relationships with many emerging artists begin in the Writer Director Lab which was first established in 1998. The Lab is currently co-chaired by William Burke and Jackie Sibblies Drury. Under the guidance of these mentors, four collaborative teams meet bi-weekly and generate a new play over a 12-month period. Anyone can apply to the Lab, and the Lab culminates in presentations at Soho Rep that are free and open to the public.

In its Studio program, Soho Rep commissions new plays with an upfront commitment to production. Artists are provided with workshops based on whatever is most vital to them as they bring their shows to production-level readiness. In recent seasons over 80% of Soho Rep productions were commissioned or developed in the Studio, including Wolf Play, Fairview, Is God Is, Futurity, 10 Out of 12, and more. Playwrights currently developing work through the Studio include Garrett Allen, Alice Birch, Becca Blackwell, Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas, Shayok Misha Chowdhury, Jackie Sibblies Drury, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins & Carmelita Tropicana, Raja Feather Kelly, Narcissister, Radical Evolution, and Jillian Walker.

Project Number One was initially launched in 2020 as a job creation program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and record unemployment in the theater field. It was also an experiment in prioritizing living wages for artists, even when faced with extraordinary challenges. During this time of cultural and civic recovery, Project Number One is evolving to include: ongoing staff positions for artists, budget transparency, and significant increases to production fees and salaries that are well beyond expected union minimums.

Soho Rep’s staff includes three Directors, a Director of Development and Marketing, a Production Manager, an Associate Producer, a Marketing Manager, a Development Assistant, two Project Number One Artists on staff, a part-time Facilities Manager, and two Writer Director Lab Co-Chairs, along with dozens of part-time, production contract, and commissioned theater makers.

The Soho Rep board has formed a search committee-co-chaired by Board Chair Victoria Meakin and playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, including authors and board members James Gleick and Claudia Rankine, and Soho Rep Director Cynthia Flowers.

Soho Rep is currently led by the three Directors, Sarah Benson, Cynthia Flowers, and Meropi Peponides and governed by a 19-member Board. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, Soho Rep reported revenue of $2.80M, with approximately $2.56M from contributions and grants and $240K from program services. Total expenses were $2.77M.

Community

Home to more than 4.8 million people, the City of Boston and the Boston-Cambridge-Newton metropolitan area is New England’s economic and cultural hub. The region is the ancestral home of the Massachusett, Pawtucket, Wampanoag, and Nipmuck, among others who inhabited the area for centuries before European colonists settled in the area in the late sixteenth century. Today, Greater Boston is the 11th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Cambridge and Boston are separated by the Charles River but share a vibrant student population with more than 200,000 students and an exciting blend of cultures. Cambridge has become a hub for technological innovation and is part of Boston’s comprehensive public transportation system (MBTA) with Downtown Boston and Logan Airport only a short ride from campus.

The region is recognized for the strength and international reach of its education, health, and technology sectors. The area attracts dedicated faculty and ambitious students who choose to study in one of its many outstanding higher educational institutions. Quality of life is anchored by a vibrant arts and cultural sector with world-renowned museums, orchestras, historic sites, regional cultural centers, emerging and experimental performing and visual arts entities, and multi-disciplinary cultural heritage organizations. Individual artists and creatives from all disciplines and genres are active contributors to the region’s vibrant arts sector. Cambridge, like other regional communities, is enriched by immigrant communities, including recent arrivals. The local high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin, is the only public high school in Cambridge and has become a deep partner to the Harvard Art Museums and thus with the extended community, in part because of the school’s physical proximity to the museums.

Chief Philanthropy Officer- Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco,None,"San Francisco, California, United States","Organization

The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) comprised of the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park and the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park is experiencing transformative growth in its mission to deepen engagement with the art and ideas of today. As the largest public art museums in San Francisco, FAMSF welcomes more than 1.5 million visitors annually and is among the most visited museums in the United States. The de Young Museum and Legion of Honor ignite a creative curiosity in visitors, reflecting their past and stimulating creative agencies in their futures. By taking an inclusive and equitable approach in presenting its extraordinary collection of over 150,000 works, FAMSF is both a cherished community hub and vibrant beacon in the global art world. 

FAMSF Director and CEO Thomas P. Campbell leads a vibrant and innovative program and strategic plan in which diversity and inclusion are the guiding principles. The museums annually host a prolific and comprehensive lineup of exhibitions and educational programs. In 2022, notable exhibitions at the de Young Museum include Alice Neel: People Come First, the first and only venue for American artist Alice Neel’s paintings, drawings, watercolors, and rarely seen film; the Obama Portraits Tour; and Faith Ringgold: American People, an exhibition of her work never before seen in the Bay Area. At the Legion of Honor, Guo Pei: Couture Fantasy celebrates the extraordinary designs of Guo Pei—hailed as China’s first couturier—and presents over 80 works of exquisite craftsmanship, lavish embroidery, and remarkable fashion techniques. Alongside it, Benoit Éditeur presents 15 rarely-seen, stunning fine-art editions produced from the atelier of Pierre André Benoit of Alès, France—13 of which are illustrated books with Pablo Picasso.

The de Young Museum collections include the most comprehensive survey of American art in the American West, international textile arts and costumes, photography, and art of the Americas, Oceania, and Africa. In 2005, the museum’s expansion and new facilities by Herzog & de Meuron reframed the museum by engaging it with the surrounding park and creating a setting that explores the diversity and intersection of different cultures. The Legion of Honor, built in 1924 and approaching its Centennial year, is sited on the headlands of Lands End overlooking the Golden Gate. Its collections include The Thinker and other masterworks by August Rodin, European decorative arts and paintings, Ancient art, and one of the largest collections of prints and drawings in the country. The Penny and James Coulter Objects Conservation Center, the Sardegna Paintings Center, the George and Marie Hecksher Textiles Conservation Center and the Paper Conservation Center support and complement the museums’ collections, providing preservation and scientific study that is both culturally sensitive and authentic. 

FAMSF provides an expansive variety of community-centered public programs and educational opportunities for visitors, educators, and learners of all ages. FAMSF’s efforts to engage new and diverse audiences include Free Saturdays, a free general admission day for Bay Area residents; the annual de Youngsters Day Out; and concerts featuring the 1924 Legion of Honor Spreckels Organ. FAMSF encourages meaningful artistic experiences, uplifts educators, and collaborates with community groups, schools, and city organizations through a rich array of programs. The Diversity and Innovation Fund was launched in 2021 and supports the Equity School Partnership project which serves the museum’s kindergarten through fifth grade public-school programs. 

The FAMSF are governed by three boards. FAMSF is a Charitable Trust Department of the City and County of San Francisco. The Museums’ endowment funds are held by The Fine Arts Museums Foundation (FAMF), a private 501©3 organization. The Corporation of the Fine Arts Museums (COFAM) is also a private 501©3 organization, which raises funds for and manages most of the day-to-day operations of the museums. COFAM has a 46-member Board of Trustees led by President Jason E. Moment, and Thomas P. Campbell serves as Director and CEO. FAMSF has a 13-member Board of Trustees, and the Fine Arts Museums Foundation has an 11-member board. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, FAMSF reported a total revenue of $73.9 million with $33.5 million from contributions and grants, $9.5M from membership and $7.4 million from program services. Total expenses were $71.8 million.

Managing Director- George Street Playhouse,None,"New York City, New Jersey, United States","Organization

The George Street Playhouse (GSP), New Brunswick has been a vital cultural institution and an impactful creative force locally and nationally for almost 50 years. With a mission to enrich lives by producing world-class theater, GSP seeks to shape and be shaped by its diverse community while sustaining a supportive home for top arts professionals. Founded by Rutgers faculty member Eric Krebs in 1974, GSP opened in a repurposed supermarket in New Brunswick and takes its name from its original George Street location. The company moved into the former New Brunswick YMCA in 1984, becoming the first professional theater constituent of the New Brunswick Cultural Center. In 2017, the company moved to the former home of the New Jersey Museum of Agriculture, before moving into the newly built the state-of-the-art New Brunswick Performing Arts Center in 2019. The space features two theaters: The Arthur Laurents Theater with 253 seats and The Elizabeth Ross Johnson Theater with 465 seats as well as rehearsal and office space. 

Artistic Director David Saint has led the Playhouse since 1997, producing exciting and acclaimed seasons comprised of new works, classics, and new and revived Broadway plays and musicals. Many shows developed or produced at the Playhouse have recently been seen on and off Broadway, garnering awards at every level, including the Outer Critics’ Circle Best Musical Award-winner The Toxic Avenger, It Shoulda Been You which transferred to Broadway in 2015; the Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk, and Drama League-nominated production of The Spitfire Grill; and the Broadway hit, Tony®, and Pulitzer Prize winning play Proof by David Auburn, which was developed at GSP during the 1999 Next Stage Series of new plays.

Exciting new educational programs are being launched for the 2022-2023 season. These programs are inspired by the work of Arts Ed NJ, the New Jersey Department of Education’s 2020 Visual and Performing Arts Student Learning Standards (NJSLS), and research on culturally responsive teaching and learning, prioritizing social emotional learning competencies and embedded with equity, diversity, and inclusion. GSP focuses on an artistic way of knowing as the foundation for authentic educator professional learning experiences and student learning experiences (school-based residencies and theater-based mainstage offerings) that take students beyond the text of a play and immerse them in the community of live, contemporary theater—what was happening on stage, backstage, and in the house itself. The Playhouse looks to build future audiences through summer camp programs and adult programming, including the Actor’s Studio, and the Industry-Pro series. 

GSP is governed by an 18-member Board of Trustees, led by Chair James Heston and President Penelope Lattimer. The staff includes approximately 25 full-time and contract staff as needed. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, GSP reported a total revenue of $4.3 million with $3.5 million from contributions and grants, $443,761 in program service revenue, and $393,290 in other revenue. Total expenses were $3.1 million. 

Community

New Brunswick is a thriving city of over 55,000 permanent residents located on Lenape homeland along the southern bank of the Raritan River in central New Jersey. It is the seat of government for Middlesex County and best known as the home of the main campus of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. It was incorporated as a town in 1736 and chartered as a city in 1784. The city occupies 5.8 square miles and is a mixture of a micropolis and a college town that offers the energy of a large city with a vibrant culture and a grounded sense of community. 

New Brunswick is home to many diverse neighborhoods, with historic architecture and independent businesses. The population is also quite diverse, with 50% of its residents identifying as Hispanic or Latino, 25% as white, 15% as Black or African American, and 10% as Asian. The area around Rutgers’ main campus is home to a large and diverse Latin community as well as New Jersey’s largest concentration of young people living on their own for the first time. Located just an hour from New York City and 90 minutes from Philadelphia with ample rail service and a lower cost of living, New Brunswick has become a haven for commuters. The area has seen an enormous amount of urban renewal including the revitalization of the downtown area, the completion of the Performing Arts Center, and the much-anticipated $665 million New Jersey Innovation and Technology Hub, which will be a unique 560,000-square-foot building that will bring academic, public and private sector scientists together. 

Rutgers is the largest employer in the area but the city is also known for its concentration of medical facilities and companies. The city’s connection to the healthcare industry goes back to 1866 when the Johnson brothers started their company in a New Brunswick factory mill. Johnson & Johnson is still headquartered in New Brunswick along with RWJBarnabas Health and medical school, Rutgers Cancer Institute of NJ, and Saint Peters University Hospital.

New Brunswick is teeming with arts and culture including the museum of the American Hungarian Foundation; Above Art Studio, where African American Art is showcased; and the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, one of the largest university-based museums in the country featuring over 60,000 permanent works of art. Performing arts abound as well with the State Theatre, Crossroads Theatre Company, The American Repertory Ballet, Rutgers University Mason Gross School of the Arts, the New Brunswick Jazz Project and New Brunswick Chamber Orchestra. There’s a world of outdoor activities to enjoy as well. The Raritan River Canal offers great hiking and biking paths as well as Buccleuch Park and Boyd Park which features river and skyline views.

Executive Director- Vermont Arts Council,None,"Boston, New York, United States","Organization

The mission of the Vermont Arts Council (VAC) is to cultivate and advance the arts and creativity throughout Vermont. The Council is committed to building a state where art, culture, and creativity are at the heart of its communities. Engagement with the arts transforms individual lives, connects people more deeply to each other, energizes the economy, and sustains the vibrant cultural landscape that makes Vermont a great place to live. The Council prioritizes expanding arts opportunities, cultivating creative placemaking, and energizing Vermont’s creative economy. 

VAC was founded in 1965 and is the state’s primary provider of arts funding, advocacy, and information. Supported by private and public funds from the National Endowment for the Arts and the State of Vermont, a total of $2,923,181 in Arts Council funding was awarded in FY2022. Grants were awarded to 121 individual artists, 217 organizations in every county, and 121 towns across Vermont. Headquartered in Montpelier, VAC is the only state arts agency in the United States that is also an independent nonprofit, allowing VAC to advocate in the state legislature for funding and policies. VAC delivers funding to the state’s creative sector in several ways including direct grants for artists, grants for the creation of public art and art in state buildings, grants to arts and cultural organizations, and support for arts programs in schools. VAC also supports artists and the cultural community by fostering connections with each other and with a variety of educational, accessibility, and funding resources; arts directories; and statewide classified ads. 

In recent years, VAC asserted itself as a vital resource by assisting the cultural community in navigating the intense (and continuing) disruptions of the pandemic. VAC successfully advocated for and administered unprecedented amounts of relief to Vermont artists and cultural organizations. In FY2022, the state legislature and the governor made a unique investment—the allocation of $9 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds—to the Vermont Arts Council designated for grants to creative sector nonprofits and for-profit entities to help them recover from the pandemic. In addition, funding allocated in the last legislative session was deployed statewide to transform and expand traditional arts and cultural programming into the new digital space. New philanthropic partnerships increased the size and scope of Arts Council grants to artists and cultural organizations, helping to strengthen the state’s cultural landscape in its pandemic recovery and to build the long-term sustainability of the state’s vibrant creative sector. VAC’s COVID-19 relief programs have included Digital Capacity Grants, Rapid Response Artist Relief Grants, Cultural Relief Grants and Cultural Recovery Grants for organizations (in partnership with Vermont Humanities), and sponsorships for outdoor arts events. 

One of VAC’s main initiatives is the Vermont Creative Network (VCN), which was established by the Vermont Legislature in May 2016. The VCN is a broad collective of organizations, businesses, and individuals working to advance Vermont’s creative sector and is focused on promoting statewide investment in systems that allow creatives to grow and thrive. In 2021, the VCN launched a statewide CreateVT Action Plan, which won state and regional Plan of the Year awards and was instrumental in making the case for the $9 million COVID-19 relief grant program for the creative sector. The advocacy agenda focuses on investing in cultural infrastructure, promoting creative local economies, investing in digital capacity, and developing entrepreneurial and business skills. 

VAC works with the Governor’s office to recognize contributions in the Vermont arts community each year, honoring individuals and organizations with a variety of awards. Awards are given for excellence and achievement in the arts, arts education, arts advocacy, and service to the arts. 

Inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) initiatives are prioritized internally and externally. In 2020, a staff committee was formed devoted to pursuing IDEA in all VAC activities and have been implemented in employment policies, grantmaking practices, and outreach procedures. In 2022, the committee established a network of IDEA advisors from the field in order to continue and expand this work. The IDEA Advisory Network brings together creative leaders, community organizers, and working artists with expertise and lived experiences in pursuing social justice in and through the arts; it will help set and pursue IDEA priorities and disseminates the work to diverse communities. 

Vermont Arts Council has a 16-member Board of Trustees led by Chair Rebecca McMeekin. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, Vermont Arts Council reported a total revenue of $4,392,446 and total expenses were $4,367,031. 

Community

Known as the Green Mountain State, Vermont is a socially, culturally, and environmentally progressive state that is home to some of the country’s most beautiful natural settings. Located at the westernmost edge of the New England region, the population is about 625,000 and is made up of small vibrant cities and quaint towns, all offering their own distinct environment with a common throughline of community, civic pride, and creativity. A unique and dynamic culture, Vermont is consistently ranked one of the safest places to live, one of the best states to live in and to raise a family, and one of the healthiest states in America. The educational system is highly ranked and the strong transportation infrastructure makes even the most rural areas accessible. 

With a long tradition of respect for the land, Vermont is the most environmentally-conscious state in the country and is a leader in self-sufficient living. Vermonters are serious about year-round outdoor recreation and the state offers everything from skiing and hiking to cycling and sailing. There is a thriving culinary scene featuring innovative local food systems, inventive farm-to-table offerings, artisan cheesemakers, and the most craft breweries per capita in the United States. The state is well-known for its number of living and working artists and for its commitment to the creative economy. A 2019 study showed that 9.3% of Vermont jobs—more than 40,000—are in the creative sector, defined as design, specialty foods, visual arts and fine crafts, performing arts, film and media, literary arts, and culture and heritage. 

The Vermont Arts Council offices are located in Montpelier, across the street from the Vermont State House, in a historic house that was the childhood home of Senator Patrick Leahy. The capital of Vermont, Montpelier is a micropolitan area in the foothills of the Green Mountains. It sits on Abenaki homeland at the confluence of the Winooski and North Branch Rivers. With a population of 8,000, it is one of the smallest state capitals in the country, but it boasts a vibrant community that is both sophisticated and welcoming. Montpelier is home to a thriving arts community featuring theatre, live music venues, and a bustling business district that includes many independently owned shops. “Local is a way of life” in Montpelier and it is distinctly the only state capital without a Walmart, McDonalds, or a Starbucks. It is conveniently located 3 hours from Boston, 5 hours from New York and 2.5 hours from Montreal. There is an Amtrak Vermonter station and Burlington International Airport is 32 miles away. The Vermont College of Fine Arts and Community College of Vermont call Montpelier home and the elementary and secondary schools are rated as some of the best in the state.

Chief Administrative Officer - Roundabout Theatre Company,None,"New York City, New York, United States","Organization

Founded in 1965 and based in New York City, Roundabout Theatre Company (Roundabout) has grown to become one of the country’s largest nonprofit theatrical institutions. Roundabout operates three venues on Broadway— American Airlines Theatre, Stephen Sondheim Theatre, and the historic Studio 54—and two venues off-Broadway—Laura Pels Theatre and Roundabout Underground Black Box Theatre, which are housed in the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theatre.

With a mission to celebrate the power of theatre by spotlighting classics from the past, cultivating new works of the present, and educating minds for the future, Roundabout presents a wide variety of familiar and lesser-known productions, including musicals, revivals of classic plays, and cutting-edge new works. The organization is highly respected for its innovative and high-quality productions and has received numerous awards in its 57-year history, including 38 Tony Awards, 73 Outer Critics Circle Awards, 14 Obie Awards, 5 Olivier Awards, and 14 AUDELCO Awards, which are awarded annually to recognize and honor excellence in Black Theatre.

Addressing and correcting social injustices is a key cornerstone of Roundabout’s values. The organization announced a five-year strategic plan in September 2021 to address equity, diversity, inclusion, and anti-racism (EDI/AR) in its work, workplaces, and community to create a theatre company that is more equitable and inclusive. This strategic plan lists a series of EDI/AR targets to be achieved within the next five years which include growing the percentage of racial representation in the stories it presents, creative teams it hires, staff in its offices, audiences it welcomes, and board leadership it appoints.

Roundabout has received national recognition for its educational programs. The organization has established numerous longstanding partnerships with schools throughout the five boroughs of New York City, creating customized residencies, free afterschool programs, and on-site experiences for students. The Roundabout Youth Ensemble is a program for New York City public high school students that uses Roundabout’s production model to explore the theatrical production process.

Roundabout is committed to removing all physical, cultural, or financial barriers to make theatre accessible and affordable to all people regardless of their background. The organization has introduced several special ticket programs and audience development initiatives that allow people to see productions at significantly reduced prices. These include Access Roundabout, which allocates more than 42,000 affordable tickets to theatregoers annually; Hiptix, which provides $30 tickets to all shows for theatregoers ages 18 to 40; Hiptix High, which provides $10 tickets to all shows for high school students ages 14 to 18; and Blue Star Families, where United States military families and veterans receive a 40% discount on tickets.

Engaging deeply with audiences and communities is central to Roundabout’s mission. Theatre Plus is a series of innovative programs that enhances the theatre-going experience for audience members. It includes talks led by teaching artists, casts, and crews. To deepen audience engagement, Roundabout hosts 20-minute post-performance conversations between audience members to share their thoughts and engage in lively discussions.

Roundabout is governed by a 45-member board of trustees, led by Katheryn Patterson Kempner. Artistic Director and CEO Todd Haimes leads a staff of 175 people. Due to the pandemic, Roundabout’s theatre venues and operations were shut down on March 12, 2020 and re-opened in the autumn of 2021 with its postponed production of Caroline, or Change. For the 2019 fiscal year, Roundabout reported total operating revenue of $62.9 million, with $39.1 million from program services. Total expenses were $67.8 million. As comparison, for the fiscal year audit ended August 31, 2020, Roundabout reported total operating revenue of $39.9 million, with $18.3 million from program services and total expenses of $48.9 million. Roundabout remained shut down for the 2021 fiscal year resulting in an operating revenue of $23.1 million, with $151,000 from program services and total expenses of $23.1 million.

Irish Arts Center has recently completed construction of a $60 million landmark new permanent home, including a state of the art flexible performance and arts space for the presentation and development of work across a range of disciplines, including music, dance, theatre, film, visual arts, literature and the humanities; classrooms and studio spaces for education programs, development, and collaboration; technology to stream and distribute content on the digital platform; and an avenue-facing lobby café that will be a hub for hospitality and interaction between artists and audiences. As part of a second phase, IAC will renovate its adjacent existing 51st Street building to provide a second, intimate performance space—the historic Irish Arts Center theatre—optimized for the most intimate live music and conversation, recordings, podcasts, master classes and special events, and a beautiful new courtyard entrance on 51st Street where the historic Irish Arts Center and the new building will meet.

Chief Marketing Officer- Overture Center for the Arts,None,Online,"Organization

Overture Center for the Arts (Overture Center), dedicated on September 18, 2004, in the heart of beautiful downtown Madison, Wisconsin, supports and elevates the community’s creative culture, economy, and quality of life through the arts. Overture Center’s unwavering commitment is to be the region’s preeminent stage for wondrous artistry, to develop diverse and emerging talent, and to be the arts’ epicenter for community engagement. It aspires to provide extraordinary experiences for all. 

Overture Center features seven state-of-the-art performance spaces and five galleries where national and international touring artists, nine resident companies, and hundreds of local artists engage people in nearly 700,000 educational and artistic experiences each year. Overture Center takes great pride in offering spectacular performances as well as free and low-cost programs to nurture creativity, curiosity, and diversity while helping drive the local economy and supporting a vibrant and growing city. 

Designed by César Pelli, the centerpiece of the 388,000-square-foot facility is the 2,255-seat Overture Hall, a crisp geometric form in limestone and glass with a grand lobby that extends over the sidewalk to shelter the entrance. Inside the lobby, light-wood ceilings and travertine flooring all help create a warm and serene atmosphere. In the auditorium, a cascade of softly lit balconies and an undulating acoustic ceiling define a contemporary space. Unobstructed sightlines, excellent acoustics, and state-of-the-art technical support enable flawless performances for music, theater, dance, and much more. 

The 1,098-seat Capitol Theater retains original details, including its Grand Barton Organ, ornate ceiling, wall niches, proscenium arch, and chandelier lighting. The Playhouse, a 347-seat thrust theater, was redesigned to add three flexible black box theaters. An architectural landmark, the design of the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art consists of a triangular four-story glass lobby and stairs that recalls the traditional entrances of museums around the world. By integrating existing venues and elements of historic buildings, the complex maintains the pedestrian-friendly character of downtown Madison. The circa 1920 stone façade of the former Yost’s Department Store was retained as an entrance to the entire Overture Center. At the center of the complex, the glass façades of Overture Hall links with the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, a separate nonprofit organization with independent governance, operations, and building maintenance. A new glass dome brings sunlight to all levels of the building. Inside is a four-story rotunda with art galleries off the main lobby and the Rotunda Stage, an indoor amphitheater. 

In addition to its dynamic resident companies, part of Overture Center’s great value is in its presentation of performances. The 2022-2023 season brings over 37 performances, including the Tony-Award winning productions of Six and Hadestown and five other Broadway titles, as well as Overture Presents touring productions, the acclaimed UpClose series and Cabaret Series, National Geographic Live presentations, and free Kids in the Rotunda shows. 

Overture Center also recognizes its tremendous and unique responsibility to the community to ensure it is a true reflection of the society in which it exists and with the humanity that it shares. Representing a variety of constituencies, Overture’s Community Advisory Council makes recommendations to Overture Center staff regarding community and educational programming. The Council recommends opportunities to deepen and enrich community engagement and helps develop relationships with community constituents and organizations. 

Overture Center Foundation, Inc., a private 501c (3) nonprofit corporation, became the sole operator of Overture Center on January 1, 2012. Overture Center Foundation is governed by a 24-member board of directors, chaired by John Surdyk. Overture Center engages a total full-time staff of 75 employees, more than 136 part-time and variable front of house staff, more than 256 variable stagehands, and more than 500 volunteers. 

Its 2019/20 Annual Report stated revenues of $22.6 million, which included $17.6 million in program services, $2.3 million in contributions and grants, and $1.6 million through the generosity of the City of Madison. 2020/21 financial information is not included as it is not reflective of a typical year for Overture Center due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations. 

Community

With a population exceeding 258,000 residents, Madison is a city of neighborhoods and strong communities with a vibrant cultural hub of art, music, food, and more. The capital of Wisconsin and the state’s fastest-growing city, Madison has an economy that features a large and growing technology sector and serves as the home to many corporate headquarters. Access to schools, hospitals, and infrastructure; affordability and income; and how residents take advantage of those opportunities are a few key reasons why the Madison region and Dane County continue to be one of the best places to live, work, study, and enjoy a high quality of life. 

With almost 48,000 students, the University of Wisconsin-Madison strongly believes in improving people’s lives outside of the classroom. Known as the Wisconsin Idea, this tradition includes collecting and distributing farm crops for needy families, mentoring and tutoring programs for local school children, and a university policy that offers free humanities courses to low-income adults. Educated young professionals continue to move into high-density rental units throughout Madison’s downtown area, with high demand fueled by the proximity of the university and large private-sector employers. 

The five lakes in the city’s vicinity offer ample recreational opportunities, such as fishing and boating, and the 1,260-acre University of Wisconsin Arboretum provides 20 miles of trails. USA Today ranked Madison in its list of 10 best cycling towns due to its widespread network of bike paths and lanes and its convenient bike share program, BCycle. NerdWallet named Madison as the greenest city in America, awarding high marks for air quality and a ratio of 12.7 parks per 10,000 residents—more than any other city. The ranking considered Madison’s 200 miles of hiking and biking trails and the fact that there are more bicycles in the city than cars. Madison also has a relatively high number of green jobs and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings and venues.

Executive Director- Levitt Pavilion Denver,None,"Los Angeles, Colorado, United States","Organization

Levitt Pavilion Denver (LPD) is a grand social initiative that harnesses the power of live music and the performing arts as an outdoor venue to transform audiences into neighbors that share a love for culture and community. LPD finds common ground between people who vary in class, race, and socioeconomic status beyond its free programs and events. While event production is LPD’s main focus, it remains a tool to build a better Denver, and a better world. In the 2022 season, LPD saw almost 140,000 visitors, about 80,000 at their free concerts and about 60,000 at their ticketed events.

LPD opened in 2017 with an open-air stage and state-of-the-art sound and lighting. Its lawn seating utilizes the park’s natural topography, and the venue includes an outdoor concessions plaza and performer amenities. Shortly after it opened, it was nominated by Pollstar as a “Best New Concert Venue” and named by Billboard as “one of the freshest venues to check out”. LPD is also the centerpiece of a 2009 master plan to improve the use of Ruby Hill Park in Denver. LPD is now known as a key Denver music venue, consistently offering free family-friendly programming, while also supporting local musicians by always providing fair pay and above-market rate wages for a more equitable and community driven venue. Ruby Hill Park also includes a mountain bike skills park, a playground, picnic areas, a community garden, football and softball fields, and a winter rail yard.

LPD’s states its mission is “to bridge cultural gaps and to find ways to heal schisms, erase divisions, and embrace differences in the communities we serve. We believe that nothing brings people together better than music; to truly build and revitalize communities around it, it has to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay.” LPD endeavors to build community through free-to-access music and has a firm commitment to hire local talent – not only in the musicians and artists who are paid an above-market rate, but also the staff and sponsors. LPD also invests in the next generation of creative artists through its Bodies of Culture program, an initiative that “supports BIPOC youth in the Greater Denver Area to participate in music through initiatives that celebrate cultural identity and self-expression, understand the healing power of music, and empower musical self-discovery and exploration.”

LPD offers 50 free concerts yearly, comprising of local, regional, national and international acts and spanning a wide variety of musical genres. Since 2017, the total value of these free concert, based on ticket pricing across the United States, is over $32 million. In addition, 15 to 20 ticketed concerts were offered through a partnership with Live Nation, and the venue is available for event rentals.

In 2021, through a multi-stakeholder process, LPD created a strategic plan with the desire to make the Levitt Pavilion a world-class music and performing arts venue for the Greater Denver area. Key elements to be developed and implemented under the new Executive Director include improvements in marketing strategy, supporting the new initiatives being outlined, and additional board development; ideally community driven and data-led to increase cultural partnerships and the developments of these programs.

In the future, LPD wishes to program a more varied roster of concerts, making their offerings attractive to a wider, more diverse audience, reflective of the neighborhoods surrounding the venue and inclusive of the Denver community at large, both in programming and artists performing on stage. An emphasis on community-engaged music going and outreach will be included in this process, as will assuring bilingual access. Further, the plan raises the question of an off-season presence for LPD, to “sustain attention and loyalty”. 

With a visionary Executive Director, LPD will begin to establish its artistic staff as “thought leaders” in the public eye and in the arts and music community, bringing the venue’s visibility and impact to the forefront of Denver’s competitive music scene. 

LPD is part of a three-pronged public and private partnership between Denver Parks and Recreation, the Friends of Levitt Pavilion, and the Mortimer & Mimi Levitt Foundation. The Levitt Foundation has other permanent venues on public land in Los Angeles, CA; Arlington, TX; Westport, CT; Bethlehem, PA; Sioux Falls, SD, and Dayton, OH, with more planned. Levitt Pavilion Denver consists of a 16-member Board of Directors and a staff of approximately six full-time workers and 156 seasonal staff. For the fiscal year ending 2021, reported total revenue was $3.5 million, with $3.2 million from sponsors, donors, grants, and concessions. 

Community

Denver, Colorado’s Mile High City, sits at the base of the majestic Rocky Mountains and enjoys 300 days of sun per year. Approximately 716,000 residents live in the city and almost 3 million people live in the greater metropolitan area. The demographics of Denver are representative of a diverse community, with a population breakdown as follows: 50% White, 29% Hispanic, and 10% Black, with the remaining population belonging to mixed race, American Indian, Native Hawai’ian and other Pacific Islanders.

Founded in the mid-1800s on the traditional territories and ancestral homelands of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Nations, Ruby Hill Park and the Levitt Pavilion are on the ancestral land of the Očhéthi Šakówiŋ peoples. According to the ACSM American Fitness Index, Denver is the fourth-fittest city in the United States due to its affordable healthcare and more than 5,000 acres of parks, trails, golf courses, playgrounds, hiking, biking, and year-long mountain adventures.

Denver’s central downtown area is thriving with shops, restaurants, nightspots, and galleries. A mile-long pedestrian mall cuts through the heart of the city near the United States Mint, Denver Art Museum, Denver Botanic Gardens, and Denver Center for the Performing Arts. The addition of three new stadiums within the last seven years for the Colorado Rockies, Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and Denver Broncos shows the embrace of the professional sports teams in the state.

Highlighting the rich cultures of the area, special events celebrating diversity happen year-round, including Denver March Powwow, one of the nation’s largest Cinco de Mayo celebrations; Colorado Irish Festival; Colorado Gay Rodeo; Denver PrideFest; Museo de las Americas; and Art District on Santa Fe. The Five Points neighborhood is home to the Black American West Museum and the Five Points Jazz Festival. Denver is also home to the University of Denver, University of Colorado Denver, and Regis University, among others.

Production Manager- South Coast Repertory,None,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Organization

South Coast Repertory (SCR) was founded on the belief that theatre has the unique power to illuminate the human experience. SCR is committed to exploring urgent human and social issues of this time, and to blending literature, design and performance in ways that test the bounds of theatre’s artistic possibilities. It advances the art of theatre in service of its community and aims to extend that service through educational, intercultural, and community engagement programs that harmonize with its artistic mission. 

Founded in 1964 by Martin Benson and David Emmes, SCR is led by Artistic Director David Ivers and Managing Director Paula Tomei. SCR produces year-round on three stages, the 507-seat Segerstrom Stage, 336-seat Julianne Argyros Stage, and 94-seat Nicholas Studio. The productions, including annual holiday favorite A Christmas Carol and a Theatre for Young Audiences and Families offering, meet the highest standards of artistic and literary excellence. As of this writing, SCR has realized 541 full productions in 58 seasons including 157 world premieres, 91 of which were plays commissioned by SCR. With a history of nurturing long-term collaborations with gifted playwrights, more than 30% of the repertoire are new plays. 

Responding to the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, SCR introduced Outside SCR, which features fully staged, family-friendly productions outdoors at the historic Mission San Juan Capistrano each summer. Through an integrated, multi-initiative play-development program known as The Lab@SCR, South Coast Repertory commissions playwrights at various stages of their careers, develops new work through in-house readings and workshops, and is committed to the development of new American musicals. The centerpiece of The Lab@SCR is The Pacific Playwrights Festival which annually showcases seven new plays, a combination of readings and full productions, over a three-day weekend. 

SCR also serves the community and the field through an on-site Theatre Conservatory, offering a wide array of year-round acting classes. Along with other education and outreach programming, the Conservatory serves students of all ages. The Junior, Teen, and Summer Players—advanced students in the Youth Conservatory, are featured in three productions annually. 

South Coast Repertory is governed by a 27-member Board of Trustees, led by President J. Steven Duncan. David Ivers has served as Artistic Director since 2019. In 1988, SCR received a Tony® Award for distinguished achievement. It operates under an agreement between the League of Resident Theatres (LORT), Actors’ Equity Association, the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society and United Scenic Artists, the union of scenic, costume, lighting, and sound designers. For the 2023 fiscal year, SCR adopted a $11.7 million dollar budget, with 31% of revenue derived from ticket sales and conservatory tuitions, 26% from contributions and grants, and the remaining 43% from other revenues including endowment earnings and reserve allocations derived from special government funding due to COVID-19.

Community

Costa Mesa offers rich history, growing neighborhoods, and world-renown arts and culture offerings all only one mile from the Pacific Ocean. Since its incorporation in 1953, the city has grown from a semi-rural farming community of 16,000 to a thriving, urban-suburban mix locale with a population of almost 110,000 in 2022. Located on the coastal tableland above Newport Beach, Costa Mesa’s first inhabitants were native American Indians who settled on the mesa near the banks of the Santa Ana River. The city is nestled in the heart of Orange County, just 37 miles south of Los Angeles and 88 miles north of San Diego. 

Known as the “City of the Arts,” Costa Mesa is also home to Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Pacific Symphony, Orange County Museum of Art, Costa Mesa Playhouse, and the 1.6-acre Noguchi Sculpture Gardens. Costa Mesa’s nonprofit arts organizations generate $110 million in revenue and the total economic impact of these organizations is $521 million. The City of Costa Mesa Cultural Arts Committee is an appointed volunteer group that works with City Council to establish ongoing programs, community events and useful information that helps residents access the arts in many different venues, and through multiple sources. 

Costa Mesa is one of the region’s largest commercial areas, with an economy based on luxury retail, commerce, and light manufacturing. The largest center of commercial activity is South Coast Plaza, a shopping center noted for its architecture and size. The volume of sales generated by South Coast Plaza, on the strength of its more than 270 stores, places it among the highest volume regional shopping centers in the nation. South Coast Metro is a commercial, cultural, and residential district surrounding South Coast Plaza. Some manufacturing activity also takes place in the city, mostly in the industrial, southwestern quarter, which is home to a number of electronics and pharmaceutical firms. Business services company Experian is the largest employer in the city. As the capital of the action sports industry, many related companies make their corporate home here, including Hurley, RVCA, Vans and Volcom. 

With famously mild temperatures and nearly year-round sunshine, Costa Mesa is a haven for outdoor adventure. There are many impressive cycling and hiking trails, a municipal golf course, and the Huntington Beach and Newport Beach are just minutes away. There are 26 local parks, including Talbert Regional Park which has nearly 200 acres of scenic landscape great for hiking, biking, or jogging and serves as a botanical garden and a wildlife refuge. The city is convenient to many transportation options including the bus and shuttle service and in close proximity to the 405 freeway, an Amtrak stop, and the John Wayne Airport, which is less than five miles away. Costa Mesa schools are highly rated, and the city is home to many education institutions including Vanguard University, Orange Coast College, and University of California, Irvine which is just minutes away.

Founded by Dr. Robert Gumbiner in 1996 and accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in 2016, MOLAA celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2021.

In 2017, MOLAA successfully recruited Lourdes I. Ramos-Rivas, PhD as its President & CEO to lead the museum’s expanded vision and future.

The museum’s founder established a vision for the organization: to educate the American public about modern and contemporary Latin American fine art through the establishment of a significant permanent collection and the presentation of dynamic exhibitions and related programs. In 2014, MOLAA’s board of directors approved an expanded scope of the museum’s mission to also include Latino art. Pre-pandemic, MOLAA attracted approximately 65,000 visitors annually to its exhibitions, festivals, educational programs, and showcases highlights from the permanent collection consisting of more than 1,300 works of art, as well as emergent collections of new media and art of the Latino diaspora. In that time, MOLAA also presented a diverse array of artists including: Judithe Hernández, Nuna Mangiante, Robert Graham, and Osmeivy Ortega.

Executive Director- Hugo House,None,"Washington, Washington, United States","Organization

Founded in 1997 by the writers Linda Breneman, Frances McCue, and Andrea Lewis, Hugo House is a Seattle-based nonprofit organization and home for everyone who values reading and writing. Named after and inspired by the Seattle-born poet and creative writing teacher Richard Hugo, Hugo House celebrates its mission to open the literary world and make the art of writing accessible to anyone interested in reading or writing through creative writing programs. Since its inception, more than 150,000 writers and readers have taken part in Hugo House’s programs, classes, workshops, and residencies. Notable writers who have presented work and taught classes at Hugo House include Min Jin Lee, Roxane Gay, Sheila Heti, Jericho Brown, Anthony Doerr, Ada Limón, Rick Bass, Lauren Goff, Viet Tanh Nguyen, Ruth Ozeki, and Mary Ruefle.

Hugo House originally occupied a 16,000 square feet Victorian House on Capitol Hill, which was once home to the New City Theatre. In 2018, the organization moved into a new space on Capitol Hill that it owns, and for which it carries no associated debt. This space was designed and built specifically to Hugo House’s specifications. 

Hugo House presents a wide range of literary programs, for people of all ages and of all levels of experience, to experience the joy of the written word. There are in-person and online courses covering a wide range of writing styles and experiences, taught by published writers. Students come from a variety of backgrounds and classes are offered for adults and children. The primary educational programming consists of four seasonal catalogs of classes and workshops for adults including free classes, free writing-circles, and free consultations with writers-in-residence: some 300 offerings serve 3,000 writers and readers annually. 

Several programs are specifically designed to offer opportunities for young people, including Youth Workshops, are offered throughout the academic year; the Scribes Summer Camp, which provides longer workshop sessions during the summer; and the Young Writers Cohort, where participants focus on poetry or prose alongside a group of fellow young writers and an instructor. 

Hugo House is a recognized thought-leader for other similarly structured literary arts organizations around the United States. Its signature Word Works brings acclaimed and talented writers from around the country to share their knowledge of the writing craft. Every year, Hugo House’s Literary Series commissions new prose, poetry, and songs based on a thematic concept. The popular Ask a _______ invites writers, editors, publishers, booksellers, and literary agents to discuss their worlds and engage in Q&A sessions with the Hugo House community. 

Hugo House is currently engaged in a 5-year strategic plan which began in 2020. As part of this, Hugo House has four goals: to become a transformative space where writers can come together to grow in their art; to engage new groups of people, creating opportunity to connect more deeply with the power of the written word; to be welcoming to all writers and readers, advancing racial equity and ensuring diversity and inclusion; and to build a lasting future for Hugo House, securing the resources necessary to accomplish its vision and thrive. 

Hugo House is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and is working towards racial equity at all levels of the organization. Hugo House has formed a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) committee, comprising community members, staff, and board members. This committee advises on how the institution can better serve communities of color and promote racial equity through programming, board, staff, faculty composition, and community outreach. The DEI committee is in the process of hiring a racial equity consultant for long-term engagement. Hugo House recognizes that achieving transformative change is a long, often uncomfortable, process that requires careful thought and dedicated attention. Acknowledging its role in structural and systemic racism, Hugo House is grateful for a thoughtful community that holds it accountable with courage and commitment. Over half of Hugo House’s current staff are BIPOC, as is one third of its board. 

Hugo House is governed by a 11-member Board of Trustees, led by Shahina Piyarali. The staff is comprised of 14 part-time and full-time employees. Rob Arnold has served as Interim Executive Director since March 2021. For the fiscal year ending 2020, annual revenues were $2.1 million, with approximately $800,000 from contributions and grants and $1.3 million in program service revenue. 

Community

Situated on the traditional land of the Duwamish and Coast Salish People, Seattle is a port city on Puget Sound and part of the Pacific Rim. The land around the city is home to multiple indigenous tribes—and named after Chief Seattle (1780-1866) of the Duwamish and Suquamish. Founded in 1852, the city and adjacent region lie north of Mount Rainier and rest between the Olympic and Cascade Mountain range. The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area is home to approximately four million people. According to the 2020 census, Seattle had a population of 737,015 people.

Seattle has been designated a City of Literature by UNESCO and is known for its love for libraries and independent bookstores. Seattle’s traditional businesses, centered on fishing and logging, were eclipsed first by Boeing and the aerospace industry, and then by Microsoft and the advent of digital technology. Today, many technology-related companies, notably Amazon, are major employers. Seattle has a highly educated population and many institutions of higher learning, including the University of Washington, Seattle University, and Bellevue College. The economy and the allure of the Pacific Northwest has created a young, educated, diverse, and progressive workforce.

Hugo House is one of the city’s many vibrant arts and culture organizations, including Seattle Opera, Seattle Symphony, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Langston Hughes Performing Arts Institute, and more than 80 theater companies. The cities’ dozens of museums include the Seattle Art Museum, which includes the Asian Art Museum and Olympic Sculpture Park, Wing Luke Museum, Duwamish Longhouse and Cultural Center, Northwest African American Museum, and the Holocaust Center for Humanity. Seattle’s legendary music scene is showcased in venues grand to intimate, from McCaw Hall and Paramount Theatre to The Crocodile and Neumos.

Seattle’s maritime climate creates endless opportunities for outdoor recreation on land and water, including skiing, hiking, boating, camping, and biking. Sports fans cheer on several professional teams including the NFL Seattle Seahawks, MLB Seattle Mariners, WNBA Storm, NWSL OL Reign, Sounders FC, and NHL Seattle Kraken, along with several college teams.

Executive Director- Brooklyn Arts Council,None,"New York City, Delaware, United States","Organization

“The Brooklyn borough’s authentic story is diverse and inclusive, rebellious and steeped in history.” Brooklyn Arts Council (BAC) has been integral in the creation of Brooklyn’s culture, by forging and continuing to lead with a commitment to equity and inclusion for over 50 years. In 1966, a group of Brooklyn residents passionate about sustaining the borough’s artistic heritage convened in the basement of Charlene Victor’s Flatbush apartment to establish the Brooklyn Arts Council (then known as the Brooklyn Arts and Cultural Association, BACA) as a platform to support individual artists in Brooklyn through vibrant arts programming and services. Victor became the inaugural Executive Director of BAC and was subsequently appointed to New York Governor Hugh L. Carey’s 38-member Task Force on the Arts. 

By the 1980s, many local artists had found creative community at BACA Downtown, BAC’s Willoughby Street performance space and gallery. Inclusive and accessible arts education became another one of BAC’s efforts by utilizing innovative curriculum through varied genres. During this same period, BAC expanded in grant-making on behalf of the New York State Council on the Arts and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. BAC became more than an arts council, serving as a transformative community hub for the borough. Through their current mission—to enrich the quality of life of the residents of Brooklyn through the promotion of the arts in the community—they host large celebrations, judge competitions, sponsor film series, and join forces with local organizations to diversify both fundraising and cultural performances that reflect the city and its communities. 

BAC grants support local artists and small arts organizations whose work enhances the cultural climate of its borough, city, and stat. Recognizable Brooklyn natives gained early support and financial assistance through BAC, including filmmaker Spike Lee and playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, before reaching internationally recognized status. In 2022, BAC awarded just over $1 million in grants to 185 individuals and organizations.

Through the Incubator, BAC provides fiscal sponsorship and supports emerging cultural and artistic projects that have strong artistic merit and align with BAC’s mission. Fostering creativity and artistic expression for K-12 students, parents, and community members, the Arts in Education programs cover a wide-range of diversity and excellence in dance, digital media, theater, visual, and literary arts. The BAC Wellness Studio builds on the mission of empowering artists, which is fundamental to the prosperity and spirit of Brooklyn, and the Cultural Heritage program works with artists in traditional cultural practices to preserve and present arts expressive of the borough’s diverse living heritage. Professional development, on-demand programming, and arts consultancy are supplemental offers that speak to the intersections of art, equity, and accessibility. 

Led by Chairman Toni Yuille Williams, BAC is governed by a 17-member board of directors. An advisory group, that includes the Executive Director, Board Chair, and a mix of internal and external stakeholders, brings a diverse set of perspectives to the organization’s mission and goals. The Executive Director oversees a team of 16 staff members covering operations, programming, development, cultural heritage, education, and strategy. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, BAC had total revenue of $4.14 million, with $4 million from contributions and grants and $137,433 from program service revenue. Total expenses were $4.04 million.

Community

The traditional and unceded lands of the Lenape or “Lenapehoking” was an offspring of Algonquin civilization and included present day New Jersey, New York, and Delaware. The lands were later named Breuckelen by Dutch settlers after a municipality in the Netherlands. Brooklyn was a thriving independent city before becoming a borough on New York City in the late 19th century, shortly after the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge connecting the city to Manhattan. Brooklyn is a consolidation of other cities and counties that were combined to form a borough in the modern City of New York; however, it continues to maintain a distinct culture.

Brooklyn is home to the largest number of the world’s leading artists, New York City’s most populous of the five boroughs and second largest in size. It’s population in 2022 reached 2.59 million, and if it were its own city, Brooklyn would be the fourth most populous in the United States. In the 2010 census, Brooklyn was 35.8% white/non-Hispanic, 35.8% African American, 11.5% Asian Pacific Islander, 2.2% Mixed Race, 8.9% other race, 1.0 % Native American, including 19.8% Hispanic or Latino of any race, with 38% of residents being immigrants. It is a vibrant community where many languages are spoken, including Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Yiddish, French Creole, Italian, Hebrew, Polish, French, Arabic, Indic languages, and Urdu. 

Brooklyn Arts Council sits in the Dumbo neighborhood, close to the Manhattan Bridge, full of cobblestone streets, and surrounded by converted Brooklyn warehouse buildings. Within the neighborhood, there are independent boutiques, high-end restaurants, and trendy cafes. Brooklyn has more than twenty distinct neighborhoods and world class cultural organizations including Kings Theatre, Brooklyn Museum, and the NY Transit Museum. Designed by Central Park creators, the 526-acre Prospect Park is home to a zoo, the first urban area Audubon center in the nation, an ice rink, and dozens of athletic and recreations facilities.

"Deputy Director, Philanthropy and External Relations- The Newark Museum of Art",None,"Philadelphia, New Jersey, United States","Organization

The Newark Museum of Art (NMOA), a cultural anchor institution in Newark for more than a century, welcomes diverse experiences that spark curiosity and foster community. One of the most influential museums in the United States, NMOA’s renowned art collections educate, inspire, and transform individuals of all ages. Founder John Cotton Dana stated, “a good museum attracts, entertains, arouses curiosity, leads to questioning and thus promotes learning.” The largest visual art and art education institution in New Jersey, NMOA’s distinguished 130,000 artworks and some 170,000 science and natural history specimens are international in scope and ranked 12th in size nationally. It comprises significant holdings of science, technology, and natural history: an Asian Art collection with the most important assemblage of Tibetan art in the West; one of the nation’s earliest and most comprehensive collections of African Art; 18th- to 21st-century American painting and sculpture; Decorative Arts; and an Ancient Mediterranean collection featuring unparalleled works of ancient glass.

NMOA is dedicated to artistic excellence, education, and community engagement with an overarching commitment to broadening and diversifying participation in the arts. The Museum hosts ambitious exhibitions and education programs which recently included Saya Woolfak: Field Notes from the Empathic Universe (2022); Carlos Villa; Worlds in Collision (2022); and Wolfgang Gil, Sonic Geometries (2021). The Museum frequently collaborates with the vibrant community of contemporary artists living and working in the Newark region. NMOA also responds to the evolving needs and interests of the diverse audiences it serves by providing virtual, in-person and off-site programs, a research library, partnerships, and resources reflective of contemporary life. In 2022, the Earth Sciences galleries was renovated to present several immersive and participatory experiences focused on the animal kingdom and endangered species. Popular signature programs include Summer Camps, Community Days, Art After Dark, the Summer Series, the Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration, and the Newark Black Film Festival—the longest-running Black film festival in the United States. Long considered the birthplace of museum-based education, NMOA offers a wealth of on-site and off-site school programs for New Jersey students from Pre-K through 12th grade, as well as professional development training sessions for teachers.

The Museum is currently executing a three-year strategic plan focused on infrastructure, innovation, enhancing the visitor experience, embedding equity in all aspects of its work, and engaging as a social anchor in the community. Museum Parc, a, $85 million mixed-use project designed to create a campus around NMOA, will expand the existing garden and add a new modern gallery space that can provide additional installation space and community engagement opportunities. 

NMOA Board Co-Chairs Allen J. Karp and Eric Fitzgerald Reed lead the 24-member Board of Trustees, and Linda Harrison serves as Director and Chief Executive Officer. The annual operating budget for FY21 was $16.2 million. In 2021, 50% of the budgeted operating revenue was from government sources, 23% from contributions, 9% from earned sources and 19% from endowment. The staff of more than one hundred employees includes a Philanthropy and External Relations team with 17 budgeted staff members whose responsibilities include fundraising, membership, marketing and communications, visitor experience, special events, and third-party rentals.

Community

Founded in 1666, Newark, New Jersey enjoys a rich cultural legacy fueled by waves of immigration. As the financial, commercial, and transportation nucleus of the Garden State, as well as its largest city, Newark is a cosmopolitan community boasting a wide selection of exceptional dining, shopping, entertainment, and sports venues. Noted by former Newark Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson, “Wherever the central cities of America are going, Newark is going to get there first.” Newark is a thriving cultural hub filled with events and attractions for visitors from near and far. The state’s premier center for the performing and visual arts, Newark offers a rich variety of theater, dance, and music, as well as an array of museums and galleries that highlight art and history. According to Arts and Economic Prosperity 5, a study conducted by Americans for the Arts, the nonprofit arts and culture sector is a $178 million industry in the City of Newark. The SMU National Center for Arts Research ranked Newark as the seventh most arts-vibrant community in the nation out of the 40 communities surveyed across the country in 2020—reflecting the Newark community’s prominence in presenting the arts and culture, its history as a major hub of the Black Arts Movement, and its ongoing proficiency as a cultivator of artists. 

Newark is ideally located with easy access to Manhattan and Philadelphia. The city is home to almost 300,000 residents and is at the crossroads of New Jersey’s Gateway Region of four million residents. It has long been an important center of higher education, with more than 50,000 students, faculty, and staff filling the six colleges and universities located in its downtown business district. This historic city is experiencing rapid growth. A multitude of new restaurants and services have opened to support the thousands of residential units recently completed, under construction, or being planned. Numerous corporations have moved significant operations to Newark, including the United States headquarters for Mars Wrigley Confectionery, Panasonic, Audible, and Broadridge Financial Solutions. Other corporations have been major anchor institutions for more than 50 years, such as Prudential Financial, Public Service Enterprise Group, and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. Newark also offers plentiful access to many regional attractions including 61 state parks and forests, 130 miles of beaches, and four professional sports teams.

Executive Director- Diamond Head Theatre,None,"Sale, Morocco","Organization

For more than a century, Diamond Head Theatre (DHT), located on the slopes of Diamond Head in Honolulu, Hawaii, has served as Hawaii’s “Broadway of the Pacific”. Opened in 1915, DHT is Hawaii’s oldest performing arts center and the third oldest continuously operating theatre in the entire United States.

On April 28, 1915, a new theatrical group called The Footlights, founded by prominent Honolulu kama’āina (local residents) Will Lewers, Mrs. Walter F. Dillingham, Helen Alexander, Margaret Center and Gerrit Wilder, presented The Amazons by Pinero at the Honolulu Opera House. In 1934, The Footlights reorganized and took on a new name: Honolulu Community Theatre. In the original mission statement, “community service through the art of theatre, involving the people of Hawaii as audience members, stage crew, and performers” is honored and committed to today. 

During World War II, Honolulu Community Theatre productions entertained thousands of troops at over 300 performances throughout the Pacific. In 1952, Honolulu Community Theatre took up permanent residence at Ruger Theatre, the aging movie house of army base Fort Ruger. Although never designed for stage productions, the 1930s war-era movie house was retrofitted to include a scene shop and costume center. Lighting and sound systems were installed. A first-ever lobby for their patrons was opened and an upstairs addition for office space, spotlights, and lighting boards were added. In 1990, Honolulu Community Theatre was renamed Diamond Head Theatre. Each season, DHT offers six mainstage theatrical productions, including five major musicals. 

Education continues to be fundamental to DHT’s mission. Theatre workshops are provided to train kama’āina in the theatrical arts. A variety of classes including acting, voice and dance classes for keiki (children), teens, and adults are offered throughout the year. The theatre offers an extensive summer school program for keiki and teens and is home to youth performing troupe Diamond Head Theatre Shooting Stars. 

The pandemic offered a new perspective for the creative staff of DHT, with drive-in outdoor performances and loyal support from its neighboring community. Conjunctively, in the Fall of 2020, the organization broke ground on a brand-new performing arts complex. The new structure is being built adjacent to the existing theatre, which will allow shows and programs to continue throughout construction. Highlights include the following: a nearly 500-seat auditorium and stage, expanded dressing rooms, orchestra pit, fly loft, additional restrooms, and an expansive outdoor entrance overlooking newly created green space. Other amenities will include an expanded scene shop, loading dock and ultimately, expanded spaces for class offerings, nearly doubling enrollment capacity. A capital campaign continues to support the move into the new state-of-the-art facility slated for a 2023 opening. 

As an independent, local, and nonprofit organization led by a versatile and close team comprised of staff and a board of directors, DHT has truly developed into a community center and a gathering place for people of all ages. The theatre community is composed of actors, musicians, production crew members, directors, designers, school groups, educators that are a theatrical ‘ohana. The productions include an all-volunteer cast and crew who celebrate entertainment with the joy of music, song, and dance. Currently the 2021-2022 season includes: Oliver!, Elf, Steel Magnolias, Jesus Christ Superstar, Waitress, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

DHT has a 35+-member board of directors led by Chairman Rick Chong. Executive Director Deena Dray will be retiring from her role in early 2023, after 28 years of service and the substantial completion of a successful capital campaign resulting in the brand-new theatre building. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the financials from fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 most accurately represent DHT’s regular operations and are provided here. DHT reported a total revenue of $4.7 million with $3.5 million from contributions and grants, and $943,143 from program services. Total expenses were $2.1 million. 

Community

On the lands of the Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian), Diamond Head (Lē’ahi) sits prominently near the eastern edge of Waikiki’s coastline, as part of Hawaii’s state capital Honolulu. It is home to the saucer-shaped crater that was formed around 300,000 years ago during an explosive volcanic eruption. The Diamond Head-Kapahulu population is 21,079 of the 349,597 living in Honolulu.

Bringing together the beautiful patchwork community of varied diversity, the mo’olelo (stories) of the lands continue to change, evolve, and improve. At Diamond Head Theatre, the spirit of the Hawaiian islands is woven throughout individuals’ lives as it permeates amidst the island. Both integral and connected to Honolulu and geographically separate from the mainland, DHT possesses a culture connected to the United States as a community theatre accessing mainstream entertainment while exuding the aloha culture.

Awareness to the histories of Hawaii and its communication styles are paramount, which DHT holds true to these values. Ideas around the definition of ‘ohana (family) in the artistic sense is important to the DHT community. Decisions are made with an inclusive lens at every level of DHT, and the DHT ‘ohana incorporates an acute perception of listening to the needs of the community and coming together for a common purpose. During the pandemic, DHT maintained its sustainability largely due to this ‘ohana culture and aloha spirit. The community came together, alongside DHT, to understand its fundamental core purpose—entertain through a sense of community togetherness to all it touches. 

Within the work culture of DHT, work-life balance is not something just said but lived by. Aligned to the proponents of island time and island culture, what one does for a living professionally is not equivalent to their sense of worth, but how they live outside the walls of their job as well. These values are integrated into every aspect of the DHT community and can be found in everything kama’āina take part.

One of the premier music organizations in the southeastern United States and the oldest operating symphony orchestra in the Carolinas, the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra (CSO) connects with more than 100,000 music lovers each year through its lively season of concerts, broadcasts, community events, and robust educational programs. The CSO has demonstrated a commitment to its mission of uplifting, entertaining, and educating the diverse communities of Charlotte-Mecklenburg and beyond through exceptional music experiences. Celebrating its 90th anniversary in 2022, the CSO continues its vision to reach out through the transformative power of live music as a civic leader, reflecting and uniting the region. 

The CSO employs a professional full-time orchestra of 62 musicians and three conductors, supports three youth orchestras, and offers an extensive array of educational and audience engagement programs. The CSO performs in a variety of venues in Charlotte-Mecklenburg and surrounding counties in the Charlotte region, principally at the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center’s Belk Theater (1900 seats), the Levine Center for the Arts’ Knight Theater (1100 seats), and Symphony Park at SouthPark Mall. Its extensive community engagement activities take the CSO’s music to a variety of churches, breweries, community centers, schools, and senior care centers throughout the region. 

The 2022-2023 season will feature 11 guest conductors, including the CSO debut of Erina Yashima leading Beethoven’s rarely performed Triple Concerto and Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastique, and Cleveland Orchestra’s Vinay Parameswaran conducting Benjamin Britten’s Les Illuminations and William Grant Still’s Poem for Orchestra. The Sandra and Leon Levine Pops series will explore a wide range of musical genres, highlighted by 007: The Best of James Bond, a celebration of five decades of music for the iconic spy films. Legendary film scores come to life in the CSO’s popular Movie Series, a true “surround-sound” live experience. Additionally, the CSO is opening the 2022 Charlotte International Arts Festival with a newly commissioned production of David Bowie’s final album, titled Blackstar Symphony. The CSO is one of 25 orchestras in the United States to receive Catalyst Fund grants from the League of American Orchestras to advance equity, diversity, and inclusion within the organization. 

The CSO 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, completed in May 2021, focuses on seven essential areas of strategic focus: artistic vitality and growth, education, financial health and sustainability, innovation, organizational culture, public relevance, and audience development. Strategies to advance the CSO’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion are incorporated within each area. This plan serves as a road map for CSO, pointing the orchestra towards an enterprising and resilient future.

The CSO is governed by a 30-member Board of Directors chaired by Linda McFarland Farthing. David Fisk was appointed President & CEO in 2020. For the last 12 years, the artistic leadership of the CSO was under the baton of internationally renowned Music Director Christopher Warren-Green, who has now taken on the titles of Conductor Laureate and Artistic Adviser. Emerging American conductor Christopher James Lees is the Resident Conductor of the CSO and Principal Conductor of the Charlotte Symphony Youth Orchestra. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, the CSO is reporting total revenue of approximately $11.8 million, with over $6 million in contributions and grants (excluding government or other special assistance related to COVID relief), and just over $3 million in ticket sales and program services. Total expenses in FY22 were approximately $11.3 million.

Executive Director - New England Foundation for the Arts,None,"Boston, Connecticut, United States","Organization

The New England Foundation for the Arts (NEFA) invests in artists and communities fostering equitable access to the arts, enriching the cultural landscape in New England and the nation. NEFA is a grantmaker, program initiator, aggregator of resources, and builder of creative partnerships among artists, arts organizations, businesses, and funders. Founded in 1976, NEFA is one of six regional arts organizations established with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts and regional state arts agencies to strengthen the national arts infrastructure by cultivating the arts on a regional level. Today NEFA’s programs are regional, national, and international in scope, and support artists and communities through grants and other opportunities in the performing arts, public art, and the creative economy. This work is generously supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, the New England state arts agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual donors. Convenings, network building, online tools, and a 45+ year history of data-driven research on the economic impact of the arts are essential complements to NEFA’s role as a dynamic organization.

In 2017, NEFA completed a new strategic plan for 2018 to 2021, outlining six organizational values: artists and the creative process; equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA); knowledge building and sharing; leadership; partnership; and public funding for the arts. These values live at the core of NEFA’s strategic priorities and have continued to guide the organization’s efforts during the pandemic and will be the basis for the next strategic planning process, which will be a priority of the new Executive Director. 

NEFA’s programs support organizations and artists across diverse forms of expression, cultural roots, and many geographies, connecting them with collaborators and communities that fuel creative exchange and public discourse, and strengthen the creative economy. NEFA staff are nationally recognized leaders in the fields of presenting and touring, international cultural exchange, creative economy, public art, dance, and theater. NEFA is working at the forefront of advancing equitable grant making practices and supporting diverse artists, organizations, and communities. NEFA programs are deeply rooted in relationships with artists, organizations, and communities. All NEFA staff work collaboratively to support these connections to ensure the organization remains informed and responsive to the evolving field. Relationships that reach much deeper than grant transactions guide NEFA’s commitment to move the fields of the arts and philanthropy in new and more equitable directions. Over the course of the pandemic, teamwork across NEFA’s departments has enabled the organization to develop new skills and accessible tools, to continue its work, and to maintain and strengthen its relationships in the virtual realm. 

NEFA has a 21-member board of directors led by Chair John Henry which includes the Directors of New England’s six state arts agencies and a talented, nationally and locally recognized staff of 27. For the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, NEFA’s board has approved a budget with a total revenue of $11.3 million and total expenses of $11.2 million. NEFA is a multi-state organization and an evolving and dynamic workplace. NEFA staff work in a variety of contexts, including in-person in Boston and remotely across New England and New York.

Co-Artistic Directors,None,Online,"ABOUT ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATRE

Ensemble Studio Theatre (EST) was founded by Curt Dempster in 1968 with a group of 20 theatre artists. It has since grown into a company of over 600 actors, directors, playwrights, designers, and other theatre artists. Curt Dempster and the group of fellow artists who founded EST, who included Jon Voight, Elinor Renfield, Jerry Zaks, Danny DeVito, Roger Morgan, Diane Venora, and others, developed a three-tiered founding concept embodied in the company’s name: Ensemble (a lifetime membership and fellowship of artists); Studio (a creative lab for new works); Theatre (a producing venue for plays developed by the ensemble in its lab environment).

EST believes that a commitment to inclusivity is essential to yield extraordinary work and is working to end systemic marginalization and oppression at all levels of the organization. Since 2013, EST has engaged in a deepening process of transformation toward becoming an inclusive and anti-racist organization. They recently commissioned an independent study to delve deeply into every aspect of their operations and identify White supremacist practices and assumptions. This analysis guides the current leadership transition as they prepare to hire two Co-Artistic Directors. The goal is to create a more holistic, inclusive, intentional, and healthy work environment. 

EST develops and produces plays from the first read through to full productions on their mainstage and beyond. Their Marathon of One-Act Plays, first produced in 1977, launched an industry-wide revival of the short play form and broke new ground by putting new and established writers together on one stage. The Ensemble Studio Theatre / Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science & Technology Project is the creative engine behind hundreds of new American plays that challenge and broaden the public’s understanding of science and technology and their impact in our lives. And the Youngblood program is EST’s OBIE-winning collective of emerging professional playwrights under the age of 30.

Plays that originated at EST have been produced at hundreds of theatres across the United States; and EST has been recognized with Village Voice Obie Awards, NY Outer Critic Circle Awards, and American Theater Wing Awards for excellence in theatre. EST received a special Drama Desk Award for its “unwavering commitment to producing new works” in May of 2015. In addition to the special organizational Drama Desk Award, EST and affiliated artists have also been recognized for individual productions, performances, and programming throughout its history. In 2022, Sonnie Brown received a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actress in What You Are Now. In 2017, EST garnered a Drama Desk Award nomination to Brian Quijada for his solo play Where Did We Sit on the Bus? Hand to God by Robert Askins, a play that originated at EST, was nominated for five Tony Awards in 2015 following its Broadway run, including Best Play and Best Direction of a Play.

Artistic Director/Producer- Ojai Playwrights Conference,None,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Organization

Founded in 1998, the Ojai Playwrights Conference (OPC) is recognized as one of the leading new play development programs in America. Led since 2001 by Artistic Director/Producer, Robert Egan, the not-for-profit Ojai Playwrights Conference has grown steadily over the years in the number of artists served, the diversity of its artists and leadership, and in acclaim. OPC is committed to developing socially, politically, and culturally challenging works that reflect the great ethnic, cultural, and ideological diversity of America. Its mission is to develop unproduced plays of artistic excellence from diverse writers both emerging and established, and to nurture a new generation of playwrights. Diversity is a major factor in the selection process to ensure the conference accurately reflects and refracts the many voices and faces of the contemporary American experience.

The Ojai Playwrights Conference is unique in its process of developing new plays for the American theatre by offering a safe, productive, rigorous haven for socially, politically, and culturally committed writers. This is fundamental to OPC’s vision. Plays are selected each fall by the Artistic Director/Producer in collaboration with OPC’s Artistic Committee, utilizing feedback from a reading committee. Full play submissions for each season are by invitation only, but playwrights are welcome to submit a resume, play description, and a 10-page sample of their work for future consideration. Each summer, selected playwrights, directors, dramaturgs, and other theatre professionals, as well as OPC artistic staff and interns, gather in Ojai, California for a two-week conference. The conference culminates in the New Works Festival, in which new plays are presented as staged readings and audiences are invited to join in post-play discussions. 

Each playwright works with a director and dramaturg throughout the two-week conference. During the first week, plays are read out loud by participants, and moderated dramaturgy begins. The actors, stage managers, and production staff join the playwrights and their core artistic teams for a week of rehearsals and continued development in advance of public workshops of their new plays during the New Works Festival. In addition to new play workshops, the festival also features the popular Intersection Series, young artist performance events, and local receptions with the artists.

The Ojai Playwrights Conference offers two educational programs: the OPC Intern Program (for college students) and the OPC Youth Workshop Program (for high school students). Both provide opportunities for young artists to engage with playwrights and artistic staff and to be mentored in the creation of their own original works, which are presented as part of the New Works Festival. Fully immersed into the OPC artistic community, the interns act as literary or directing assistants for the new play workshops and assist OPC staff with overall operations and logistics. Through the popular OPC Youth Workshop, high school students are led through a multi-day process of writing, developing, and presenting their own dramatic works, under the tutelage of veteran writing and acting coach Kim Maxwell.

The Ojai Playwrights Conference is passionate about developing playwrights and plays that challenge, investigate, and reimagine the values, beliefs, and discourses that are fundamental to the ongoing experiment that is the United States of America. Its primary goal is to fulfill the vision the playwrights have for their new works. Many of the plays developed at the Ojai Playwrights Conference have enjoyed numerous productions on Broadway, Off-Broadway, and at regional theatres across the country. Some have been nominated for and won prestigious awards. In 2019, OPC was awarded the Gordon Davidson Award for distinguished contribution to the Los Angeles theatrical community by the LA Drama Critics Circle.

OPC has a 26-member board of directors led by President Carl Thelander. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, OPC reported a total revenue of $196,890 with $187,040 from contributions and grants, and $9,250 from program services. Total expenses were approximately $181,022.

Community

“Ojai” is Chumash for “nest.” Located some 80 miles from Los Angeles and 35 miles from Santa Barbara, Ojai is located in the Ojai Valley in Ventura County, California. The first residents of Ojai were Chumash Indians, who called the Ojai Valley “Awhai,” meaning moon, according to the Ojai Valley Museum. Ojai was incorporated in 1921. The city’s self-styled nickname is “Shangri-La” referencing the natural environment of this health and spirituality-focused region as well as the mystical sanctuary of the 1937 film adaptation of James Hilton’s novel Lost Horizon. It is also reflective of the Ojai “Pink Moment,” a breathtaking watercolor sunset phenomenon resulting in the shadow of the setting sun casting down on bluffs of the Topatopa Mountains.

As a tourism destination, Ojai is known for its boutique hotels, recreation opportunities, hiking, and farmers’ market of local organic agriculture. Ojai Valley’s mediterranean climate makes for a variety of produce, including grapes and olives. It has small businesses specializing in local and ecologically-friendly art, design, and home improvement. Chain stores are prohibited by city ordinance to encourage local small business development and keep the town unique. Its downtown village is walkable and quaint, with shops, restaurants, and the Ojai Valley Museum, an exhibition hall inside a historic church, clustered along its main vein. The Ojai Music Festival is an annual festival of performances by some of the world’s top musicians and composers that occurs on the first weekend after Memorial Day. In early June, often coinciding with the Music Festival, the Ojai Wine Festival is held at Lake Casitas where over 3,000 wine lovers sample the products of more than 30 wineries.

In the 2020 census, the population was 7,637, up from 7,461 in the 2010 census. The racial makeup of Ojai was 87.9 percent White, Hispanic or Latino of any race was 17.9 percent, 0.6 percent African American, 0.6 percent Native American, 2.1 percent Asian, 1 percent Pacific Islander, 5.9 percent from other races, and 2.9 percent from two or more races.

It assists scholars, curators, and writers with research and fact-checking on Frankenthaler and her work.

It has held programs on-site, off-site, and online, often in collaboration with museum, gallery, and/or university partners. It also helps support programs at partner or grantee institutions; foremost among them is Bennington College’s Visual Arts Program and its Museum Fellows Term. 

Catalogue Raisonné 

The Foundation established the Helen Frankenthaler Catalogue Raisonné LLC to undertake documentation of Frankenthaler’s complete body of work in paintings and works on paper, as well as to update the existing catalogue raisonné of her prints (published in 1994). 

Grants 

Between 2014 and 2021, the Foundation gave more than $25 million in grants to organizations, including through special initiatives such as the Frankenthaler Prints Initiative, Frankenthaler Scholarships for MFA and PhD students, COVID-19 Relief, Equity and Justice, and the Frankenthaler Climate Initiative.

Organization

Center Theatre Group (CTG) was founded in 1967 and is ranked in the top five operating budgets for not-for-profit operating theatre companies in the United States. It is a resident company of The Music Center of Los Angeles County, one of America’s three largest performing arts centers with other resident companies that include the Los Angeles Master Chorale, Los Angeles Opera, and Los Angeles Philharmonic. CTG’s mission is:

To serve the diverse audiences of Los Angeles by producing and presenting theatre of the highest caliber, nurturing new artists, attracting new audiences, and developing youth outreach and arts education programs. This mission is based on the belief that the art of theatre is a cultural force with the capacity to transform the lives of individuals and society at large. 

Over the past 55 years, CTG has entertained millions of audience members and produced some of the most important shows of our time, many of which have been world premieres and have gone on to award-winning Broadway runs and beyond. CTG produces and presents a broad range of theatrical works in three distinct yet complementary venues: The Ahmanson Theatre (1,600 to 2,100 seats) and Mark Taper Forum (736 seats)—both leased from Los Angeles County as part of the Music Center Campus in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles—and the Kirk Douglas Theatre (317 seats), which opened in 2005 and is leased from Culver City in the thriving entertainment district of Culver City, about ten miles west of Downtown Los Angeles. Across these venues, CTG annually produces 14 to 18 productions serving an audience with over 550,000 visits per year. In addition to operating the three distinct theatrical venues, CTG leases offices and rehearsal spaces in a 1940s-era building adjacent to the Ahmanson Theatre, and owns a costume and prop shop, as well as leasing a scene shop and warehouse in nearby Boyle Heights, just east of Downtown.

CTG strives to make Los Angeles the theatre destination for audiences and artists from around the world and to make a major impact on Los Angeles, the lives of residents of the greater L.A. area, and all those who experience its artistic, educational, and community programming. CTG has been an industry leader in new play development, commissioning 65 new works and producing 40 world premieres in the last decade alone. CTG is committed to cultivating diverse artists and contributing to the cultural scene in and beyond Los Angeles by hosting workshops, nurturing playwrights, supporting local theatres, and creating art with the community. Initiatives include Block Party, an annual celebration of L.A. theatre in partnership with smaller Los Angeles theatre companies to bring greater resources and recognition to the L.A. theatre ecosystem, and the L.A. Writers’ Workshop, which fosters local playwrights, particularly from diverse backgrounds, and encourages bold new writing. In addition to onstage programming, CTG has robust and award-winning education and community programs which have long been embedded in the company as part of the dynamic culture of Los Angeles.

In October 2020, CTG launched the Digital Stage, a multimedia digital platform, to serve audiences and support its artists during the pandemic shutdowns. From on-demand streamed performances and interactive shared experiences to educational workshops, over 200 distinct projects have been created or shared by over a million households. Live performances resumed during the 2021-2022 season and the Digital Stage has been put on hold to be reexamined in conjunction with future leadership in the context of the strategic plan and vision. 

During the pandemic pause in operations, CTG responded to the industry’s call to address systemic inequities toward BIPOC communities by beginning a process of regular assessment, education, training, and change. CTG’s Commitments to Change were first posted in June 2020 and were followed by the formation of a permanent Anti-Racism, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (AREDI) committee by the board of directors, as well as ongoing communication regarding progress toward the goals. 

Over the past year, CTG board and staff have completed a comprehensive Strategic Alignment Process that included outreach to over 800 artists, audiences, donors, and other stakeholders. It ensured that individuals were engaged in CTG’s future, and that everyone in the organization has an understanding of the purpose of the company and how the envisioned future will be achieved. The result of this work was a new articulation of CTG’s Company Values:

 Artistic Ambition – We create and present a broad range of outstanding live theatrical work that is bold, authentic, provocative, engaging, entertaining, and inspiring. We support artists working at the highest levels of their own experience and craft. 

 Artistic Identity, Risk-Taking, and Innovation – The theatrical creative process is the center of our work. We collaborate with diverse, creative, and innovative artists, risk-takers, and boundary-breakers to bring great stories to life and create theatre magic. 

 Centering Los Angeles – We are a civic institution anchored in the cultural vibrancy and rich diversity of Los Angeles, committing to represent the communities that make up our great city, country, and world by bringing theatre to our stages for Los Angeles audiences. 

 Lifelong Learning, Inspiration, and Human Connection – We nurture a lifelong passion for theatre in our current and future generations. We center human connection through collaboration, inclusion, imagination, united in the power of storytelling. 

 Respect, Compassion, Social Conscience, and AREDI – Guided by our social responsibility, we lead with respect and compassion. We create opportunities, cultivate relationships, and dismantle barriers using an anti-racist frame that strives to include marginalized, underrepresented, and excluded communities.

CTG was led by Founding Artistic Director Gordon Davidson from 1967 to 2004 and was under the artistic leadership of Artistic Director Michael Ritchie from 2005 to 2021. CTG is governed by a 48-member board of directors led by President Amy R. Forbes. The board includes the Artistic Director and Managing Director/CEO Meghan Pressman, who joined the company in 2019. CTG normally employs more than 180 full- and part-time artistic and administrative staff and another 700 to 900 artists and craft personnel on a per show basis over the course of a season. In the five seasons before the pandemic, annual expenses ranged between $45 million to $65 million. The board has not yet approved a budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, but total revenue is expected to exceed $60 million with approximately $15 million from contributions and grants, and $45 million from ticket sales, program services, and other revenues. CTG has a quasi-endowment (reserve fund) of approximately $25 million and a permanently restricted endowment of approximately $25 million. 

Community

Los Angeles County is the one of the largest in the United States, with nearly 10 million residents in 88 cities and nearly 140 unincorporated areas. The Los Angeles region has the largest creative industry in the world and is bursting with talented actors, writers, directors, designers, and technical artists. According to a report by the Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles leads the nation in the creative sector of the new economy. The heart of the television and film industry is in and around the Los Angeles area and therefore a magnet for creative talent at the highest level. 

Los Angeles County ranks among the most ethnically and culturally diverse populations in the world and has at least 185 languages spoken at home. Its demographics include 9 percent Black or African American alone, 1.5 percent American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 15.6 percent Asian alone, 0.4 percent Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, 3.3 percent Two or More Races, 49.1 percent Hispanic or Latino, and 25.3 percent White alone, not Hispanic or Latino. Approximately 21 percent of the population is below age 18 and almost 15 percent is over age 65.

Los Angeles County boasts fifteen beaches, nine national parks, more than 93 museums, 11 major league professional sports teams, and four major amusement parks. Los Angeles has been confirmed as the site for the 2028 Summer Olympics, which will be the third time this dynamic community will have hosted the games. As it did in 1984, the Olympics represents a huge opportunity for the arts community. In the past, the Olympics have been paired with an arts festival, and CTG and its artistic leadership will be expected to serve as a leader in this effort, alongside the theatrical and arts communities in Los Angeles.

CTG would like to uplift and honor the native people of the Los Angeles basin who first called this land their home. CTG acknowledges that the Tongva, Chumash, and Tongva Gabrieleno native people are the Indigenous caretakers of the land upon which the theatres stand.

Executive Director- Street Poets,None,"Los Angeles, United States","Organization

Founded in 1996, Street Poets is a nonprofit poetry-based violence intervention program for high-risk youth throughout Los Angeles County, which uses the creative process as a vehicle for individual and community transformation. Formed by current Executive Director Chris Henrikson along with a group of teaching artists and formerly incarcerated youth, the organization aims to break the cycle of youth violence by harnessing the healing power of poetry and music to build community, and by bringing people of diverse backgrounds together. Street Poets serves over 1,000 people annually, through in-school workshops, retreats, community events, and other programs, designing spaces where students can share their personal stories and reveal their creative talents. 

Street Poets’ first performance was at the Los Angeles Theater Center in 1998, and in 1999, it began taking poetry performances out to local schools. At the core of the Street Poets methodology are writing workshops, which inspire young people to use the practice of poetry to bear witness to their own lives and the lives of those around them, to speak their truth and to dream a new world into being. Street Poets conducts workshops at middle schools, high schools, and juvenile probation camps throughout the Los Angeles County and beyond. One of its most impactful programs is the Poetry in Motion Van, a mobile performance venue and recording studio that inspires community creativity by empowering people of all ages and backgrounds to express themselves on the page and mic. Other programs include Good Seed Gardening—which teaches students to plant and tend gardens alongside the creation of poetry writing, the quarterly public reading series called Reading Series where students collaborate with published poets and spoken-word artists, and Rites of Passage, where students connect with the natural world through embarking on hikes, ocean trips, and retreats. Additionally, the organization produces and distributes a CD of spoken word, hip-hop, and songs each year to amplify the voices of youth and their healing power. 

Street Poets consults and collaborates with other organizations and communities to inspire both individual and systemic change, transforming a culture from one driven by fear to one that celebrates healing and the creative process. At some sites, the organization collaborates with Rhythm Arts Alliance to incorporate African drumming into their core curriculum. Street Poets has gained and applied its learning from direct and deep collaboration with a wide range of teachers, mentors, and professionals in the fields of arts education, youth mentoring, psychology, and the healing arts. Through these longstanding partnerships and ongoing collaborations, Street Poets has evolved over the past 25+ years into a multi-dimensional, highly collaborative arts education organization that serves as a practical guide for teachers, mentors, counselors, and youth to cultivate collective spaces where deep healing and transformational change is possible. 

Street Poets takes a gift-centered approach to mentoring work, recognizing that each young person is born with their own unique gift to share with the world. Spaces are created in which those gifts can be seen and celebrated. Most of the mentoring work is done in teams through which Street Poets provides guidance, healing opportunities, and access to resources. This mentoring model helps to address the practical challenges that arise in the lives of youth and alumni while nurturing their evolution as human beings. 

Street Poets has been recognized for its excellence and impactful work. For example, Street Poets received the John Anson Ford Human Relations Award in 2003 and went on to receive the Cultural Fluency Award from Mount St. Mary’s College in 2013. In addition, Street Poets was awarded two large grants enabling it to acquire a new 4,800 sq ft space that will not only serve as the new permanent residence for the organization, but also as a hub for a variety of Street Poets’ collaborators and partners.

Street Poets is governed by a 14-member board of trustees, led by Board Chair Nick Streets. The staff of seven full-time employees and three part time includes a Director of School and Community Programs, a Director of Camp Programs, a Recording Studio Director, a Grants Manager, and teaching artists, administrative director, artistic director, director of program integration.

With two years under our belt, the editors of Black and Asian Feminist Solidarities are looking for pitches and submissions to shape the next phase in this series.

Since we started this project, people in Black and Asian communities have been reckoning with grief, loss, heartbreak, and death at different scales. We are witnessing in real time the stripping of reproductive rights; the ways state-based responses to violence pit Black and Asian communities against each other; and attempts to legislate queer and trans people out of existence.

In reflecting on solidarity, we often are left with more questions than answers.

What does it mean to create and nurture solidarity at this juncture? We’re currently seeking new pitches and finished pieces that interrogate past, present, and future issues within the realm of Black and Asian feminist solidarities, and that imagine possibilities between our communities through various written forms.

Reproductive justice, care work, and labor

Speculative fiction exploring fantasy, myth, magic, histories, futures, and more

Histories, genealogies, and inheritances of movements and migration

Transnational approaches to abolition politics, including political imprisonment, war, and demilitarization

Ending caste apartheid, politics of colorism, interrogations of racial categories and hierarchies of racialization

Navigating conflicts, tensions, difficulties, contradictions, and controversies within and across communities

Joy, love, and pleasure as solidarity including gatherings, sex and romance, and humor

Engagements with feminist literatures and critique and writing as craft



We invite submissions and pitches on feminist solidarities from creative writers, poets, community organizers, workers, artists, journalists, and scholars.

We are seeking FINISHED SUBMISSIONS in the following genres and forms:



 Short creative stories across genres including speculative fiction, young adult, and romance

Illustrations, graphics, and comics

Creative nonfiction including personal essays and historical narratives

Poetry, letters, journal entries, songs, and spells



We are also open to PITCHES for:

For finished pieces, we welcome:



essays up to a maximum of 3,000 words

short fiction up to 3,500 words

poetry, illustrations, and hybrid work up to 10 pages or panels for consideration
