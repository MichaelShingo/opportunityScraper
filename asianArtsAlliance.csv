Call for Participants: “Anonymous Was the Data”,None,Online,"The Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab at Princeton University hosts an art project directed by Artist-in-Residence, Chanika Svetvilas that launches Fall 2022. “Anonymous was the Data” looks at mental health and healthcare needs of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). It does this through a voluntary survey of AAPI who acknowledge within themselves a mental health difference. The survey questions explore the relationship between mental health difference and healthcare access. Suicide is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans ages 15-24 and Asian American women ages 64+. Racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination can have traumatic impact from generation to generation. Systemic barriers can include lack of access to health insurance and money for co-pays, lack of transportation, and lack of healthcare providers that understand their experience. Each data set collected from the survey will be mapped onto a physical characteristic such as a bubble or twist, which will then, using a 3D printer, be digitized to print as distorted prescription bottles. Collectively, these pieces will fit together as a puzzle and will be available for participants to assemble.“The goal of Anonymous was the Data is for the audience to see mental health data in a new way and apply the information to their locality and personal experience.” 

The data collected is individualized and handled with care and resources of support instead of generic clinical statistics. Svetvilas is working with an advisory committee and research associates at the Ida B. Wells Lab. The project will culminate with an interactive installation at the Lewis Center for the Arts, Princeton University in September 2023 and will include a workshop, artist talk, and panel discussion.

The boy’s mother teaches him how to “play the game” - how to maneuver, perform and captivate in order to gain acceptance.

This is a paid opportunity.

LOGLINE:Fremont, CA. 2008. In the last month of summer before high school begins, an impressionable thirteen-year-old Taiwanese American boy learns what his family can’t teach him: how to skate, how to flirt and how to love your mom.

NO ACTING EXPERIENCE NECESSARY

ROLES

CHRIS WANG, aka WANG-WANG, Male (11-14) - Chinese / Taiwanese American – Impressionable, angsty, and charmingly bracefaced. Manga enthusiast, amateur cameraperson, and fledgling skate nerd. Wrestles with a complex inner sense of identity that he can’t fully comprehend yet: too Asian for the white kids, too white for the Asian kids.

Must be able to speak conversational Mandarin. Skateboarding experience a plus.

FAHAD MAHMOOD, Male (11-14) - South Asian American – Charismatic, lovable, young brown casanova (or so-he-thinks). A natural storyteller. Comes from a religious family, but Dave Chapelle, Russell Peters, and Kevjumba are his Gods. Cares about two things and two things only: staying fresh & mackin’ on girls.

JIMMY KIM - aka SOUP, Male (11-14) - Korean American – Loudmouth, no-filter goofball. Lives on a healthy diet of kimchi-jjigae, Monster energy, and underground hip-hop: Blue Scholars, Atmosphere, Nujabes are the soundtracks to his life. A loose cannon of untamed emotion. Gochujang on everything, DGAF about nothin’.

CHUNGSING, Female (40 - 60) - Chinese/Taiwanese American – Empathetic, artistic, and resilient. Exudes a motherly warmth. A youthful spirit, her age shown only by the wrinkles in her skin and graying hair. Capable of anger but suppresses it well. A Taiwanese immigrant and stay-at-home mother – the nature of which left her to poorly assimilate to “American” ways of life.

Must be able to speak fluent Mandarin

NAI NAI, Female (75 - 90) - Chinese/Taiwanese American –Skeletal face. Skin spotted with age. A round ball of Asian energy. Strong-headed and witty. Young enough to argue her point, old enough to not care if she’s wrong. Loves her Chinese talk shows and Mahjong Tuesdays. Slippers in the house, always.

Must be able to speak fluent Mandarin

VIVIAN, Female (16 - 22) - Chinese/Taiwanese American – Precocious. Booksmart. Attending UCSD in the Fall. Bright and independent, but wrestles with low self-esteem due to her constant eczema flare-ups, especially in the summer heat. Constantly bickering with Wang-Wang, but loves him deep down, even if she can’t admit it.

DONOVAN, Male (16 - 25) – all ethnicities – hometown hero & hustler with a heart of gold. Looks for every chance to make some change: odd jobs, charging gas money, slanging shoes, etc. Would rather earn one dollar than steal ten. Wants to be sponsored.

Must know how to skateboard

NUGGET, Male (14 - 20) – all ethnicities –Happy-go-lucky skate rat. Showers once a week. Radiates positivity – never not smiling.

Must know how to skateboard

CORY, Male (16 - 22) – all ethnicities –Seemingly standoffish, but just shy and awkward. The only one of the group still in school. The worst skater of the 3, but skates less now anyways because he’s studying for the SATs – wants to go to Berkeley.

Must know how to skateboard

MADI, Female (13 - 18) Hapa. Ambitious & driven. Band geek & secret Maplestory nerd. Wang-Wang’s crush. A high school Freshman – not much older than Wang-Wang, but at that age, one grade is an eternity.

JADE, Female (12 - 18) – all ethnicities – Bold, sassy, smart & stylish. 4.0 Honors student from the sister school. Into streetwear and raw denim. Wears Stüssy on picture day.

ELLIE, Female (12 - 18) – all ethnicities – Jade’s “best friend” and/or underling. Observant, always putting on. Nicer than she seems. Shier than she acts.

JOSH, Male (15 - 20) – East Asian American – Academic. Athletic. Awkward. A try-hard, but Asian excellence in all the ways his mother would want.

Miss Saigon Casting Call,05/02/2023 23:59,Online,"The White Plains Performing Arts Center is seeking both AEA & non-union performers for Miss Saigon . We are seeking a MULTI-ETHNIC cast with fantastic singing, acting and dancing abilities to play principal and supporting roles (breakdown below).

Please note there is NO housing for this production. The theater is located 35 min from NYC via train or car.

SYNOPSIS

Miss Saigon is an epic, stunning adaptation of Puccini’s opera, Madame Butterfly, by the writers behind Les Miserables. Reframing Puccini’s story by setting it during the Vietnam War, Miss Saigon is a powerful and poignant tale of love in a war-torn country. In the dangerous days before Saigon’s fall in 1975, Chris (an American GI) and Kim (a destitute Vietnamese orphan working her first night as a prostitute) fall in love. When the city falls, the lovers are forced apart, and each must find their own way, alone. When, years later, Chris is able to return to Vietnam, he brings with him an American wife. Kim, who has waited for Chris, has raised their son, Tam, who is “bui-doi”– a term for a child conceived during the horrors of war. With so much devastation behind them, Kim and Chris must decide how to move forward. Miss Saigon is a tragedy of massive proportions: passionate, profound, and heart-wrenchingly honest. With a sung-through score and tour-de-force roles for actors, Miss Saigon is a theatrical experience that will stay with you for years to come.

About Washington Project for the Arts 

Unique among arts organizations, Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) supports artist-driven projects, advocacy, and dialogue so that artists can live, work, and flourish. Artists curate and organize all WPA programming as an extension of their own intellectual research and in alignment with WPA values of collaboration, inclusion, and experimentation.

WPA’s support for artist-driven projects is based on the belief that a thriving arts community is essential to the enduring health of society, and a vision for the nation’s capital as a place that welcomes, values, and respects the presence and contributions of contemporary artists.

WPA values artists and pays artists. Its commitment to paying artists fairly made it the first arts organization between New York and Miami to be W.A.G.E. (Working Artists for the Greater Economy) certified in 2016. In 2020, 50% of WPA expenses went directly to artists. 

WPA was founded in 1975 by the art impresario Alice Denney, organizer of the legendary NOW Festival in 1966. Over the past four decades, and under the leadership of a series of dynamic directors, WPA has been at the nexus of the Washington, DC area arts community, presenting exhibitions, lectures, screenings, performances, workshops, symposia, and public art projects. Nearly every major visual artist in the District between 1975 and today has had some connection with WPA; many have sat on WPA’s Board of Directors, including William Christenberry, Gene Davis, Sherman Fleming, Sam Gilliam, Martha Jackson-Jarvis, and Maida Withers. Walter Hopps, the legendary curator, was also a board member.

WPA’s artist-driven program model was adopted in 2018 after extensive interviews with artists in the greater Washington, DC area. To learn more about WPA, please visit www.wpadc.org.

Leadership Overview

WPA has created a unique program model and organizational structure that inspires other arts organizations to be more collaborative when supporting artists.

The expanded Folger building promises a dramatically different relationship with new and existing audiences: teachers/educators, families, daytime visitors, members, academics, researchers, and scholars, general enthusiasts, and local/national/global institutional partners and funders. 

The transition to a more public-facing Folger has been ongoing for several years, and new development, communications and marketing strategies will be implemented during the renovation, scheduled to complete in fall 2023. The Folger is currently working with branding agency Truth & Consequences to develop a communication and marketing campaign specifically aimed at reopening visitation. The success of the campaign to support the renovation of The Folger is a catalyst for the next generation of board, donor, and membership support. 

Located one block from the United States Capitol Building in Washington, DC, the Folger is administered by a 22-member Board of Governors led by Chair D. Jarrett Arp, under the auspices of founder Henry Clay Folger’s alma mater, Amherst College. Director Dr. Michael Witmore leads a staff of 130 employees. For the fiscal year ending July 31, 2022, the Folger reported total revenue of $19.3 million and total expenses of $19.2 million.

Position Summary

The Director of Development serves as the lead fundraising officer of the Folger Shakespeare Library, charged with developing $4 to 5 million in annual support for the organization.

This past fall FIM launched a new brand to reflect the significant organizational change and expansion. In addition to its presented work, the organization consists of multiple artistic components including FIM Flint Repertory Theatre, FIM Flint Symphony Orchestra, and FIM Flint School of Performing Arts. FIM is currently in transition, moving from a traditional performing arts culture with defined hierarchies and siloed organizations to an inclusive and progressive integrated organization that is demanding rapid adaptation during significant business expansion.

The Director of Marketing reports to the Vice President of External Relations and serves a key role on the division’s management team. The position currently supervises the Marketing Manager, Digital Marketing & Website Specialist, and the Social Media Coordinator and will have the opportunity to further shape the future department as needed to support FIM’s long term needs. The ideal candidate will have considerable experience overseeing marketing in a presenting/producing organization and will have led marketing teams during times of organizational change. The Director of Marketing works in a patron-centered model with the External Relations team and the Artistic and Community Programs team, and will support a seamless patron journey from first touchpoint to a long-term relationship with FIM.

What Can We Do?,20/02/2023 23:59,"New York City, New York, United States","What Can We Do? (WCWD?), presented by the Asian American Arts Alliance (A4), is a micro-grant opportunity for artists looking to support the AAPI community in NYC with engaging, creative projects rooted in care. Honoring the power of art as healing, WCWD? invites artists with a desire to affect change in their communities to carry out a project in a three-month period (March 1-May 15, 2023).

The lingering effects of the twin pandemics of COVID and anti-Asian hate continue to be felt today. In response, many mutual aid groups, direct service organizations, and community and business leaders have stepped in to take care of elders and other vulnerable AAPI community members across the city.

WCWD? gives artists a chance to find their place in the care ecosystem either by complementing existing services and offerings, or creating their own.

PROGRAM GOALS

For this program, 30 NYC-based artists will be selected as project awardees by a random draw. They will each receive $500 to create and carry out ideas to engage, aid, and care for the Asian New Yorker community with a focus on Chinatown, Manhattan and Flushing, Queens.

Projects may take many forms such as performing music for seniors waiting in line at food pantries or leading workshops to create ‘zines that reinforce positive aspects of AAPI culture. While we prefer projects to be in-person activities, we understand that for safety reasons, projects may need to be virtual. You can review past projects here.

Matchmaking with Community Organizations

In the application, we ask artists to share a project idea and a community or community organization you would like to work with and/or serve through your project.

If you are selected, there is flexibility in updating the project idea and/or community if circumstances require. Any updates will need to be communicated to A4.

If you are selected, A4 is happy to facilitate an introduction to a pre-approved community-based organization in either Chinatown, Manhattan or Flushing, Queens. 

These 10+ organizations (listed below) have already agreed to being matched with an artist for a project. Should you be interested in being matched, there is a place in the application where you can select your top three organizations. Please note that there is no guarantee that you will be matched with an organization; we will try our best.

Chinatown, Manhattan



Think!Chinatown – An intergenerational non-profit based in Manhattan’s Chinatown, working at the intersection of storytelling, arts & neighborhood engagement.

Send Chinatown Love – A digital community for Chinatown’s restaurants to sustain themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. In short, Send Chinatown Love gives merchants an online platform who otherwise wouldn’t have one.

Mencius Society for the Arts – The organization’s mission is inspired by the teachings of Mengzi (better known as “Mencius“ in the west), a Chinese philosopher who believed in the notion of personal cultivation and social contract. With focus on the Chinese tradition (though by no means exclusively) Mencius seeks to enhance public awareness of classical and folk cultures and to promote personal and social benefits that are derived from learning and from disciplined pursuits. In performing arts, Mencius presents concerts, festivals and workshops under the banner of EastRiver Ensemble and EastRiver Arts Center.

Charles B. Wang Community Health Center – A federally qualified health center offering comprehensive primary care services to all, regardless of their ability to pay, their language, or their immigration history.



Flushing, Queens



Nan Shan Senior Center – The Nan Shan Senior Center in Flushing provides seniors ages 60+ with lunch, ESL classes, culture and art programs, education, health management, exercise classes as well as health and nutrition seminars and case assistance.

Undo Poverty Flushing – The group’s mission is to help move all Flushing community members out of poverty toward sustainable economic advancement using a community-informed and driven approach. The initiative is funded by the Robin Hood Foundation and is anchored by CPC and includes key collaborative partners AAFE, MinKwon, Queens Public Library, The Child Center of NY, and River Fund.

Korean Community Services of New York – Founded in 1973, Korean Community Services of Metropolitan New York, Inc (KCS) is the oldest and largest 501©(3) nonprofit organization assisting Korean-Americans and other immigrant communities in the greater New York City area with economic empowerment, social well-being, and health and wellness. KCS envisions a world where immigrant communities remain grounded in their heritage and work together with the broader community to build a better society at large.

Lewis Latimer House – The Lewis H. Latimer Fund, Inc. was established to preserve and promote the legacy of Lewis Howard Latimer, and other innovators of color who made extraordinary contributions to technology and American life. The Museum offers STEAM educational programs, exhibitions and public programs in poetry, arts, technology, and social justice. Latimer’s life story is used as a point of departure from which to examine issues of race, class, immigration and contemporary events. 

Red Canary Song – Red Canary Song is a grassroots massage worker coalition in the U.S. There are over 9000 workplaces like these across the country with no political representation, or access to labor rights or collective organizing. Anti-trafficking NGO’s that claim to speak for migrants in sex trades promote increased policing and immigration control, which harms rather than helps migrant sex workers. We also organize transnationally with Asian sex workers across the diaspora in Toronto, Paris, and Hong Kong.

YWCA Queens – The YWCA of Queens was created by the Queens community, for the Queens community and, in continuation of our legacy, strives to be of the Queens community.

Queens Botanical Garden – Queens Botanical Garden is an urban oasis where people, plants and cultures are celebrated through inspiring gardens, innovative educational programs and demonstrations of environmental stewardship. The vision of the Queens Botanical Garden’s programming is to be a leading cultural, educational, and environmental resource that reflects the diversity of our audiences in an accessible and welcoming way, and that celebrates nature, arts, culture and the history of our community in this unique garden setting.

Flushing Town Hall – The mission of Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts (FCCA) is to present multi-disciplinary global arts that engage and educate the global communities of Queens, New York and New York City, New York, in order to foster mutual appreciation.

FAQ

The following questions were submitted during the information session. If you have a question that is not answered below, please email Justine Lee at jlee@aaartsalliance.org.

Could book publishers submit on behalf of their authors?

Yes, as long as each application includes different contact information for each author, and A4 can be working directly with the author if they are selected.

Does the applicant’s location affect the chance for being selected?

As long as the applicant resides in NYC, they are eligible. If you reside in a neighborhood other than Flushing, Queens or Chinatown, Manhattan then your project idea must affect communities living in Chinatown, Manhattan, and Flushing, Queens.

Do you have to provide proof or documentation that you are a practicing artist?

We consider resumes that capture your body of work over time (projects, shows, collaborations, etc.) proof that you are a practicing artist.

What if experience on my resume does not show that I am a practicing artist?

We are willing to be flexible on what we consider a practicing artist; you need not be a full-time or professional artist to be eligible for this opportunity. As long as you practice art and creativity in some capacity and have a creative project you would like to carry out for the community, you are eligible.

Do you have Japanese organizations to match artists with? And should the Japanese organizations be in either in District 1 Manhattan or Flushing if the artist doesn’t live in those areas?

At the moment, we do not have Japanese-specific organizations to match artists with. If you have an organization in mind, please indicate what organization you plan to work with in your application. If your project affects communities living in Chinatown, Manhattan or Flushing, Queens, you do not need to reside in either neighborhood. However, if your project more broadly benefits the NYC AAPI community, and not those specific neighborhoods, you are required to reside in or be from Chinatown or Flushing. It’s either/or/both.

How many projects will be selected?

30 artists will be selected, and the total number of projects granted $500 depends on that.

If I have a project in mind that would be a collaboration, should only one person apply?

You should apply as one person and mention that you will work with a collaborator.

Can translation, language justice, and community organizing count as an art practice?

Yes, the goal of this project is to engage the community, and language justice or translation help for your community counts.

Why random drawing? Since the selection is a drawing, how do we strengthen our application?

Random drawing provides a more equal opportunity for artists who might not typically receive awards based on merit. Random drawing is also an easier lift for A4 while selecting as many artists as possible and supplying them with a meaningful cash award. There is not really a way to strengthen your application as long as you make sure your application shows that you are eligible, such as making sure your project shows care to the community.

Production Manager- South Coast Repertory,None,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Organization

South Coast Repertory (SCR) was founded on the belief that theatre has the unique power to illuminate the human experience. SCR is committed to exploring urgent human and social issues of this time, and to blending literature, design and performance in ways that test the bounds of theatre’s artistic possibilities. It advances the art of theatre in service of its community and aims to extend that service through educational, intercultural, and community engagement programs that harmonize with its artistic mission. 

Founded in 1964 by Martin Benson and David Emmes, SCR is led by Artistic Director David Ivers and Managing Director Paula Tomei. SCR produces year-round on three stages, the 507-seat Segerstrom Stage, 336-seat Julianne Argyros Stage, and 94-seat Nicholas Studio. The productions, including annual holiday favorite A Christmas Carol and a Theatre for Young Audiences and Families offering, meet the highest standards of artistic and literary excellence. As of this writing, SCR has realized 541 full productions in 58 seasons including 157 world premieres, 91 of which were plays commissioned by SCR. With a history of nurturing long-term collaborations with gifted playwrights, more than 30% of the repertoire are new plays. 

Responding to the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, SCR introduced Outside SCR, which features fully staged, family-friendly productions outdoors at the historic Mission San Juan Capistrano each summer. Through an integrated, multi-initiative play-development program known as The Lab@SCR, South Coast Repertory commissions playwrights at various stages of their careers, develops new work through in-house readings and workshops, and is committed to the development of new American musicals. The centerpiece of The Lab@SCR is The Pacific Playwrights Festival which annually showcases seven new plays, a combination of readings and full productions, over a three-day weekend. 

SCR also serves the community and the field through an on-site Theatre Conservatory, offering a wide array of year-round acting classes. Along with other education and outreach programming, the Conservatory serves students of all ages. The Junior, Teen, and Summer Players—advanced students in the Youth Conservatory, are featured in three productions annually. 

South Coast Repertory is governed by a 27-member Board of Trustees, led by President J. Steven Duncan. David Ivers has served as Artistic Director since 2019. In 1988, SCR received a Tony® Award for distinguished achievement. It operates under an agreement between the League of Resident Theatres (LORT), Actors’ Equity Association, the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society and United Scenic Artists, the union of scenic, costume, lighting, and sound designers. For the 2023 fiscal year, SCR adopted a $11.7 million dollar budget, with 31% of revenue derived from ticket sales and conservatory tuitions, 26% from contributions and grants, and the remaining 43% from other revenues including endowment earnings and reserve allocations derived from special government funding due to COVID-19.

Community

Costa Mesa offers rich history, growing neighborhoods, and world-renown arts and culture offerings all only one mile from the Pacific Ocean. Since its incorporation in 1953, the city has grown from a semi-rural farming community of 16,000 to a thriving, urban-suburban mix locale with a population of almost 110,000 in 2022. Located on the coastal tableland above Newport Beach, Costa Mesa’s first inhabitants were native American Indians who settled on the mesa near the banks of the Santa Ana River. The city is nestled in the heart of Orange County, just 37 miles south of Los Angeles and 88 miles north of San Diego. 

Known as the “City of the Arts,” Costa Mesa is also home to Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Pacific Symphony, Orange County Museum of Art, Costa Mesa Playhouse, and the 1.6-acre Noguchi Sculpture Gardens. Costa Mesa’s nonprofit arts organizations generate $110 million in revenue and the total economic impact of these organizations is $521 million. The City of Costa Mesa Cultural Arts Committee is an appointed volunteer group that works with City Council to establish ongoing programs, community events and useful information that helps residents access the arts in many different venues, and through multiple sources. 

Costa Mesa is one of the region’s largest commercial areas, with an economy based on luxury retail, commerce, and light manufacturing. The largest center of commercial activity is South Coast Plaza, a shopping center noted for its architecture and size. The volume of sales generated by South Coast Plaza, on the strength of its more than 270 stores, places it among the highest volume regional shopping centers in the nation. South Coast Metro is a commercial, cultural, and residential district surrounding South Coast Plaza. Some manufacturing activity also takes place in the city, mostly in the industrial, southwestern quarter, which is home to a number of electronics and pharmaceutical firms. Business services company Experian is the largest employer in the city. As the capital of the action sports industry, many related companies make their corporate home here, including Hurley, RVCA, Vans and Volcom. 

With famously mild temperatures and nearly year-round sunshine, Costa Mesa is a haven for outdoor adventure. There are many impressive cycling and hiking trails, a municipal golf course, and the Huntington Beach and Newport Beach are just minutes away. There are 26 local parks, including Talbert Regional Park which has nearly 200 acres of scenic landscape great for hiking, biking, or jogging and serves as a botanical garden and a wildlife refuge. The city is convenient to many transportation options including the bus and shuttle service and in close proximity to the 405 freeway, an Amtrak stop, and the John Wayne Airport, which is less than five miles away. Costa Mesa schools are highly rated, and the city is home to many education institutions including Vanguard University, Orange Coast College, and University of California, Irvine which is just minutes away.
